                                <div id="post-body-21383"><p>Ran into a few design-flaws along the way...</p><p>First was this:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/378691437637454564.png"></p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s a 2.5ish-D system, and that third-axis... how the heck was I planning to transfer motion to Z for the pen-up/down...? Came up with some lever-system (the teal thing in the middle) but it seemed pretty wonky, to say the least. Also, this system requires pulleys to be *really high* off their attached-surfaces, which would cause some torquing on the material...</p><p>This is what I&apos;m on, now:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/51451437637676271.png"></p><p>Was pretty proud of that, have it even more completely-drawn-out on paper... including the pulley-layout which results in very little torque. But just realized another design-flaw... Always figured the Z-axis wouldn&apos;t be particularly strong, what with the number of pulleys it&apos;d have to go through, but certainly good &apos;nough for a pen... but, I was kinda hoping to at least have the *option* for 3D-something... who knows what... Well, this doesn&apos;t lend itself to that well, at all... the Y-Axis carriage would hit whatever 3D thing was under it. Woot!</p><p>Early pen-and-paper sketches suggest swapping the Y and Z axes... have Z be the vertical plate attached directly to the X gliders, then slide Y left-to-right on that... Great! Except... very little stability, I&apos;m sure. It&apos;d require cutting out a significant amount of the structural-support provided by the Y (now Z) plate, and all that that was going to go behind it.</p><p>We&apos;ll see... Again, this was mostly just to get this darned pulley-thing out my system; a glorified etch-a-sketch would be a great start...</p><p>Here&apos;s the wheel-plates... I&apos;m particularly proud of the red-wheel-mounts which are snap-in. Though, I&apos;m still trying to figure out what to do about the green-wheel spacing, which would be offset by the laser&apos;s tooling-width as well as tolerances in the material-thickness...</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/688741437638144202.png"></p><p>Thinking about a diagonal notch and screws... it&apos;s vague in my mind, so far.<br></p><p>The whole system is designed to be easily-scaled, so I&apos;m kinda thinking about the smallest-size sheets they have available 7in x 7in, and possibly trying to fit everything on a single sheet... A tiny little cartesian system for fun. Maybe even snap-together... held together still as a sheet which can be snapped-apart... I dunno.</p><p>The only things necessary besides the lasered-material, then, would be cable, pins, (glue?) and pulleys... and I&apos;m contemplating how to cut a notch into laser-cut cylinders with the tools I have available...</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-21462"><p>I mighta bit off more than I could chew... was trying to get a functional-prototype done in ten days (first order free up to $20!), but my brain just stopped (or started?) working today... <br></p><p>Found yet some more design-flaws, even in reverting to that which was well-established (on paper)... the one that doesn&apos;t lend itself well to 3D... And those issues just started piling up to an insurmountable level, today.</p><p>The pulley-system I was planning to use for the third axis causes torquing on that axis... OK, fixed, now there&apos;s four more pulleys and two more cables... per axis (woot!)</p><p>Then... aww, I can&apos;t remember...</p><p>Oh, Tried to keep the openSCAD model easily-swappable between the two designs (3d-friendly vs. not) but now neither of them are working... MATH. Gave up on the 3d-friendly model for the &quot;deadline&quot;, and still can&apos;t get the 2.5d model back to where it was... Wee!</p><p>On the plus-side, I did some cleaning today... the cat knocked over a box full of books, greeting-cards, and playing-cards... it&apos;s been quite a mess for weeks. And she&apos;s been using my books as scratching-posts! Also the rolling-table/workbench had a larger surface about two months ago... I replaced that surface with a smaller one, but never retightened the screws, much to my buddy&apos;s shin&apos;s chagrin. So, that&apos;s fixed, too, ish.</p><p>The &quot;deadline&quot; fast-approaches, and I still have to figure out how to convert the 3D model to 2D SVG for cutting, which is another huge mental hurdle at the moment. I know how to do individual parts, but this thing is a 3D model of *all* the parts, put-together... So, we&apos;re about halfway through till the &quot;deadline&quot; and at this point I&apos;d already planned to start the 3D-&gt;2D process, and I don&apos;t have a full system yet to even attempt to do that with.</p><p>So, now, I have this crazy idea that if it&apos;s gonna be a snap-together &quot;kit&quot; of sorts, then why not have a bunch of pulley-locations available (holes already &quot;drilled&quot;), and make it a bit of a puzzle (kinda like the Cordwood Puzzel), like the puzzle that&apos;s going-on in my head the past few days (and 10+ years)...?</p><p>This &quot;kit&quot; could be supplied with instructions to build the model itself, but leave the pulley-locating as a challenge... &apos;cause that&apos;s how it&apos;s gonna be if I attempt to meet this &quot;deadline&quot; ;)</p><p>Anyways, I know the pulley-system *can* work; I&apos;ve *done* it... and, if done-right, they actually add to structural-stability as well as smooth linear-motion/reduced torquing... But, can it be &quot;done-right&quot; in this new orientation/layout? Remains to be seen. Pulley-Mount-Holes Everywhere!</p><p>As far as pulley-layouts... there&apos;s a couple options... The *easy* one, requiring the fewest number of pulleys, makes each axis <strong>de</strong>pendent on the others... e.g. if X moves 5mm, then the Y motor must move 5mm to compensate... This sucks as far as &quot;glorified etch-a-sketchs&quot; goes... but isn&apos;t hard to do in software... The &quot;easy&quot; one, requiring the fewest number of software-hacks (and being compatible with a &quot;glorified etch-a-sketch&quot;) requires nearly double the pulleys. On the plus side, it means that each axis is <strong>completely inde</strong>pendent of the others. This concept I dig. And it lends itself well to the &quot;glorified etch-a-sketch&quot; idea. Again, software-wise, it&apos;s completely unnecessary... how hard is it to say &quot;Y=X+y&quot;? But, again, LOTS more pulleys and cable routings.</p><p>And, frankly, the harder-software-hack version lends itself well toward testing the precision of multiple-axes WRT each other... which is something that could be worthy of attempting...</p><p>So... maybe... the solution is what I came up with earlier... lots of mounting-holes for various pulley-configurations.<br></p></div>

I figured I&apos;d continue with the one I started-with, but already ran into some (minor) difficulty: my USB-&gt;Serial converter uses 3.6V-TTL, whereas the PIC32 is running on 3.3V. Really, in this world, that should be acceptable, right...? &apos;s just a hack at this point! Well, it ain&apos;t working, and I guess that&apos;s the first thing to check.

We&apos;ve the JTAG pins, reset, and one dedicated to detection of the USB-Bus, that&apos;s it. Then there&apos;s the MX170, which appears to have 3 regular-ol&apos; GPIO pins which&apos;re 5V-tolerant and have nothing to do with USB or JTAG.

                                <div id="post-body-22408"><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6522751439199459865.png"></p><p>This is the initial-concept for a snap-together drum/driver-pulley... two &quot;forks&quot; cross-over each other and pass-through each layer of lasered-circles. (despite using transparency, the renderings don&apos;t show the forks passing-through the cylinders).</p><p>I&apos;m trying to figure out how to account for material-thickness variances (they only guarantee 10% tolerance)... so I&apos;m thinking &quot;forks&quot; coming from each side with serrated edges that when compressed together will ratchet into ever-tighter compression. It&apos;s frustrating, at this point.</p><p>Also trying to figure out how these pulleys will actually be mounted... so-far I&apos;m thinking two additional small-circles (like the red ones) on either end (outside the green)... these&apos;ll ride inside a cutout mounting-plate on either-side. It&apos;s hokey, and the amount of drag...? yeah. But it&apos;s the best I can think of. Makes hand-driving a bit difficult, having to maneuver your fingers around the mounting-plates... but, again, it&apos;s the best I&apos;ve come up with. Maybe a crank extending from one of the forks on the outside of the mounting-plate, but then there&apos;s torquing on one &quot;fork&quot; which might cause twisting... I&apos;m not opposed to glue, but I&apos;d *like* to not need it in the long-run.</p>Initial calculations suggest the driver/drum pulley can have a <p>relatively small radius and still have the cable physically attached to </p><p>the drum at one point, just a few (ten-ish?) turns are necessary for full-motion, so no need to worry about slippage...</p><p>Anyways, for attaching the motors, I&apos;m visualizing yet another circle with a +-shaped cutout that slides onto the protruding part of the &quot;forks&quot;... But, the + doesn&apos;t really work with a motor-shaft attached in the center... so then a four-hole mate at the bottom (in the image) with longer fork-prongs...? But, then, there&apos;s the serrated/ratchetting thing that was discussed earlier... so, yeah... my brain&apos;s gone to mush again.</p>In reality, this whole project is ridiculous... and more-so trying to do it without a prototype or ten of these various mechanisms. I&apos;ve got a perfectly good inkjet-printer mechanism just waiting to be hacked into a 2-axis system... attach a dremmel and probably could make many of these parts for prototyping...<p> and, yahknow, what was the original purpose of all this, again? I think, somewhere in all this, was the idea &quot;yahknow, it&apos;d be nice to have access to a CNC-machine to make cases for things, etc...&quot; which would certainly be a heck-of-a-lot easier to do off-the-bat with this lasering-order... </p><p>Oh, and, apparently the bit-banged UART receiver isn&apos;t working yet, which is surprising, to say the least, as I/O is clearly working, and precision-timing is clearly working, as well... Seems like that&apos;d&apos;ve worked pretty much right-off-the-bat. Is it the 3.6V signals feeding into the 3.3V Inputs? No, I tried feeding through a diode and a pull-up at 3.3V... so...? And the outcome is *really* weird... it seems to be echoing *several* 0xff&apos;s each time I transmit *one* byte to it. (and raw transmission from it, rather&apos;n an echo, works perfectly fine). So, yeah.</p><p>(WAIT! Is it the fact this system&apos;s so fast...? I might&apos;ve forgotten to increase those timer-comparison integer-sizes on the receiver, as I had to do on the transmitter.... TODO!)<br></p><p>Yeah, this is all as of several days ago, I&apos;m just trying to remind myself the status. </p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-23688"><p>Here&apos;s the video submitted for the 2015 quarterfinals, I decided to use it for <a data-mention-project-id="3828" href="/project/3828">#commonCode (not exclusively for AVRs)</a>... (see the previous post, regarding how these projects all kinda feed into each other). </p><iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/g6Wb8wJsOmA" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe><p>I decided to use a strange motor-driver for this project, the ST L9947. This motor driver uses a bus-interface, as in a microcontroller&apos;s multiplexed data-bus, as in it uses Data, Read/Write, and Strobe pins, rather than Direction and PWM (or similar) used on most &quot;normal&quot; H-bridges. As a result, it doesn&apos;t lend itself well to PWM. In fact, the highest rate it seems to be able to toggle the output is about 3kHz, which is pretty low, and would result in a really slow PWM frequency, if implemented the normal way. For now, iInstead of PWM, I&apos;m using commonCode&apos;s &apos;hfModulation&apos;, (I think the official name is Pulse Density Modulation?)  which toggles the output as quickly as possible, (3kHz, max) in order to achieve the desired power. This is the same code used for fading the &apos;heartbeat&apos; LED. It seems to work, but as you can see in the above video, it is quite audible on some motors (especially when mounted to a &apos;resonating chamber&apos; like a hollow tabletop!). I may try to push this chip&apos;s limits further, but before then I need some positional-feedback.</p><p>For positional-feedback, again, I decided to go a strange route... I do have DC-Motors with encoders built-in, but wanted to try something new... So I took out the box of old ball-mice (remember those?). I thought about a few other options. I have a beautiful old continuous-turn rheostat that&apos;s designed for the purpose, that will have to get used at some point! I also have a cool multi-turn inductor-tuner from an old radio that could be quite cool to implement at some point. But, for the sake of this project, I need something I can reproduce at least two, probably three times (for each axis), or more if I actually produce more than one of this thing...</p><p>Anyways, some initial experimenting with the mouse&apos;s encoder-disks and phototransistors looks promising. The most difficult part, I guess, will be attaching the disks to the shaft and still having enough shaft left-over to drive the drum pulleys (most-likely would need to be gear-reduced, as well... so we&apos;ll see. Thoughts on pulleying the cables directly around the shaft already attached to the encoder-disks, but I&apos;m not sure about slippage...).</p><p>The output of the phototransistors is analog, of course... the signal is roughly sinusoidal. The obvious choice would be to feed this signal into comparators, and the PIC32 has several. There are also thoughts about using ADCs and trying to get more resolution that way. Interestingly, I&apos;ve looked up the datasheet for the PIC16C57 used in the mouse, and it seems its inputs are TTL-level, not schmitt-triggered... So, I guess, I could maybe just treat the signals as digital. That analog-effect is accentuated by running the circuitry at 3.3V (PIC32) rather than the 5V of the original mouse, so maybe changing some resistor-values would help square things up.</p><p>The other thought was to use the mouse-circuitry as the decoder. Connect the PIC32 to it via the PS/2 protocol. This seems reasonable, except apparently PS/2 is limited to about 17kbps, at 3 bytes per packet, that&apos;d be pretty slow. And, it seems, the fastest reporting-rate for mice is 200S/s, which isn&apos;t much, considering as I recall the AVR version updated the motion-control loop around 30,000 times per second. </p>For this project (as opposed to the porting of my existing motion-control code to PIC32, which is the current goal) there&apos;s also the possibility of multi-turn R/C servos (typically used for winches on R/C sailboats, apparently). They would lend themselves well to this system, because they wouldn&apos;t require a &quot;homing&quot; routine nor limit-switches, which would be nice.<p>OTOH, I don&apos;t know much about their precision.</p><p>Anyways, here&apos;s the video:</p><iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q0t3d_M8vM4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe></div>
