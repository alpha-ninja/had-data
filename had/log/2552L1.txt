The physical manifestation of it closely resembles the original FarmBot design from the <a href="http://scribd.com/doc/169536137/FarmBot-Humanity-s-Open-Source-Automated-Precision-Farming-Machine">FarmBot Whitepaper</a>. The goal of V1 was to build something as quick as possible both to show prospective contributors that the project was "real" and to learn what was good and bad about the initial design.</p><p>Though V1 never saw anymore development past the initial track and gantry scaffolding and some playing around with the motors and electronics, it served as a quick way to learn and it continues to provide insight into the hardware design as it sits in Rory's backyard subject to the elements and different modes of failure.</p><p>V1 was developed from June 2013 to April 2014 by Rory Aronson. CAD models can be downloaded in various formats from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/FarmBot/Genesis-V1">here</a>. V1 is not being actively developed as the <a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/FarmBot_Genesis">Genesis</a> model has moved onto new versions.</p><h2>Tracks</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Genesis_V1_Tracks_Render.JPG"><img alt="Genesis V1 Tracks Render.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/5/57/Genesis_V1_Tracks_Render.JPG" width="400" height="264" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>Genesis Tracks are built using V-Slot aluminum extrusions and hardware. They provide great strength and precision and are easy to construct. The V-Slot extrusions function as the linear guides for the Genesis Gantry to move across, and the design intention allows for easy scaling in the X direction. The tracks may be fixed to the ground by attaching them to concrete pilings, burying them in the ground, fastening them with large stakes, bolting them to a raised bed, or other methods. Once installed, it will be very cost effective to scale in the X-direction by simply adding more track sections. If scaling in the Y or Z direction is desired, it may require upgrading the main track beam to a larger size in order to reduce flex under the increased loads.</p><p>Bill of Materials

</p><ul><li>Dig two holes in the ground approximately 5 feet apart (or farther if you are making longer tracks) and place your 2x4s into the holes. You will want at least one 2x4 (if not both) to be deep enough in the ground such that the top of the 2x4 is below the top of the wood plank. This is so that you can later slip on the Mini-V plate linear guide assemblies. In addition, the deeper the wood is in the ground, the more stable it will be.</li><li>Take your plank of wood and screw it into each 2x4 with four (or more) 1.5" wood screws.</li><li>Position your 2x4 and plank assembly upright and fill in the dirt, stamping it with your foot to compact the soil. Don't worry about getting it perfectly vertical right now.</li><li>Take a 20x40mm V-Slot extrusion and slide in three Tee Nuts into one slot on the wider face. Use three M5-0.8x8mm screws or bolts to loosely attach a 5-Hole Tee Joining Plate to the extrusion. Slide the plate down about 1/4 the extrusion and tighten it down. Attach another plate 1/4 the way down the extrusion from the other end. Make sure both plates are on the same side and oriented correctly on the extrusion.</li><li>Using 3/4" wood screws, fasten the extrusion/plates assembly to the wood plank, ensuring the bottom of the extrusion is flush against the top edge of the plank.</li><li>Ensuring that the tracks will be spaced properly for your desired gantry size to fit, repeat the same steps for the second track but do not fill in the dirt on one of the holes just yet!</li><li>Once both tracks are set up (with one hole yet to be filled) mount your gantry onto the tracks on the side with both holes filled.</li><li>Adjust the gantry to fit on the end with both holes filled. Once this is done, slowly move it down the tracks, adjusting the track end in the unfilled hole so that the gantry can continue to move without bending or binding. Once you are at the other end of the tracks, fill in the last hole with dirt and stamp the soil with your feet.</li><li>Run the gantry back and forth multiple times, making small adjustments to the wood plank/track assemblies until the gantry runs very smoothly through the entire length of the tracks.</li></ul><p>X-Direction Drive System
</p><p>The Genesis X-Direction Drive System utilizes two NEMA 17 Stepper Motors with 20 tooth GT2 pulleys and timing belts to move the Gantry back and forth along the Tracks.</p><h2>Gantry</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Gantry_Rendering.JPG"><img alt="Gantry Rendering.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/e/ee/Gantry_Rendering.JPG" width="200" height="132" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Gantry-Track_Interface.JPG"><img alt="Gantry-Track Interface.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/e/e7/Gantry-Track_Interface.JPG" width="200" height="132" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>The Genesis Gantry is a simple and scalable Gantry that serves as the linear guide for the Genesis Cross-Slide and the base for the Genesis Y-Direction Drive System. It is constructed with V-Slot aluminum extrusions, mounting plates, and accessories. This Genesis Gantry mounts to the Genesis Tracks and is driven by the Genesis X-Direction Drive System. The Genesis Gantry is easily scaled to be wider or narrower with a longer belt and cross-beam. This would require the Tracks to be placed farther apart.</p><h2>Cross-Slide</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Cross_Slide_Render.JPG"><img alt="Cross Slide Render.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/0/09/Cross_Slide_Render.JPG" width="150" height="150" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>The Genesis Cross-Slide is constructed from the V-Slot Universal Plate, eight Dual V Wheel Kits, and two spacer blocks. The Genesis Cross-Slide moves across the Genesis Gantry via a belt system. The Genesis Y-Direction Drive System is a simple and scalable drive system used to move the Cross-Slide in the Y-Direction along the Gantry. It consists of one NEMA 17 Stepper Motor and a GT2 timing belt and pulley.</p><h2>Z-Axis</h2><p>The z-axis is just an extrusion that is moved up and down with a leadscrew. At the end of the Z-Axis is where the tool are mounted.</p><h2>Electronics</h2><p>An Arduino Mega with a RAMPS shield and Pololu stepper drivers will be used to drive the motors and read the sensors. A Raspberry Pi will act as the host computer, communicating both with the Arduino and the web application's backend.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Genesis_V1_Tools.JPG"><img alt="Genesis V1 Tools.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/4/4d/Genesis_V1_Tools.JPG" width="180" height="360" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>Watering Nozzle
</p><p>The Genesis Watering Nozzle shown to the left and below the seed injector, consists of a spray nozzle, a solenoid valve, and tubing. Not pictured is additional tubing that will need to run along the tool mount, gantry, and tracks in order to connect to a water source such as a garden hose. Future watering nozzles may feature flow meters, different spray nozzles, or even the addition of a peristaltic pump and tank that would allow for the precise addition of liquid fertilizer or pesticide to the water spray.</p><p>Seed Injector
</p><p>The Genesis Seed Injector consists of two main assemblies: a 12V vacuum pump and selector tip, and the seed bay. The vacuum pump and selector tip are attached to the tool mount and allow for the precise selection of seeds from the seed bay and placing them at a precise location and depth in the ground. This is completed by first dipping the selector tip into a seed bin while the vacuum is on, moving the suctioned seed or seeds to the desired location, driving them into the ground to the desired depth, releasing the vacuum, and repeating. The seed bay, attached to a vertical column of the gantry, moves in the X-direction such that different seed bins can be positioned for the selector tip to choose from. The Genesis seed injector uses two controlled components: the vacuum pump, and the stepper motor for the seed bay. This setup will allow any number of different seeds to be accessed and planted without the need for additional controllable components.</p><h2>Issues with V1 and Proposed Solutions</h2><p>Genesis V1 was an initial prototype utilizing all off-the-shelf components from <a href="http://openbuildspartsstore.com/">OpenBuilds</a>. For this reason, it was a very quick and easy starting point for hardware design, allowing us to learn as much as we could as fast as possible with minimal design and part manufacturing effort. However, it also had many flaws being the first prototype and using no custom parts. Read on to see what we learned and what design changes we want to implement in <a href="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/index.php?title=Genesis_V2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">FarmBot Genesis V2</a></p><p>Track Installation</p><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisTracksConstruction.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/2/29/GenesisTracksConstruction.jpg" width="180" height="135" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisTracksConstruction.jpg"></a>Installation of raised bed and tracks.</p><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1trackinstallation.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/f/fe/GenesisV1trackinstallation.jpg" width="200" height="267" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1trackinstallation.jpg"></a>When filled with dirt, this straight track became bowed outward at the joint of the extrusions.<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The track pieces were secured to a wooden raised bed made of 2x4 posts at the corners and 0.75" thick planks on the sides. The tracks were attached to the planks using 5 hole Tee brackets. These brackets held the track extrusions flush to the planks. Because of this, the planks (and therefore the raised bed itself) had to be very square, with each track side parallel to the other. This was somewhat difficult to get right, but not impossible with the use of shims and elbow grease.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A system that allows for more flexibility when attaching the tracks to supporting infrastructure would be beneficial.</p>Track Joint Buckling<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Track pieces were connected end to end to form a longer track. Pieces were connected using double long tee nuts. The tracks started out straight, but upon filling the raised bed with soil and then a subsequent rain, the wood planks pushed out, exposing the track joint as a weak spot. The two track pieces become unaligned at this "kink" which later became so bad the high precision wheel assemblies did not want to move past the kink.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A system that allows for a stronger connection where track pieces meet would prevent kinking and allow wheels and other components to travel across easier. Designing the system to be more forgiving (lower tolerance) may be beneficial as well.</p>Track Orientation<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The orientation of the tracks was such that the wheels had to be on the sides of the tracks. However, the force from the weight of the gantry is directly downwards.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A more optimized orientation of the tracks would be so that the wheels ride on the top of them rather than the sides.</p>Belt Configuration
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1belts.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/4/4f/GenesisV1belts.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Feeding belt through the extrusions is very difficult past 3m of extrusion.<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The belts used to move the gantry along the tracks and the cross-slide along the gantry are oriented such that they "double back" and span the entire length of the tracks or gantry twice. In addition, it is nearly impossible to feed the belt through the center of more than 4m of extrusions as in the case with the tracks.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A "belt and pinion" style system, similar to a rack and pinion would be much cheaper, easier to install, and easier to tension.</p>Gantry Complexity at Track Interface
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1gantrycomplexity.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/c/c9/GenesisV1gantrycomplexity.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1gantrycomplexity.jpg"></a><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1gantrycomplexity.jpg">Excessive number and poor orientation of the gantry wheels.</a><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Each end of the gantry attached to the track with two "mini-v plates" with four "min-v wheels" each, making a total of 16 wheels attaching the gantry to the tracks. This was both expensive and a lot of work to assemble. In addition, the screws attaching the plates to the extrusions are not accessible without removing the gantry from the tracks.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A simplified system with less components and all screws accessible would be better.</p>Corner Bracket Strength and Size
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV1bracketsize.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/6/69/GenesisV1bracketsize.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>These brackets are weak and concentrate force in a small area. Their small size makes accessing the screws difficult.<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The small corner brackets used concentrate forces onto the bracket corner and provide very little strength and rigidity with such large structures. In addition, the brackets are so small that getting tools and hands into the right position for tightening screws or bolts is difficult.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Larger brackets that do not concentrate forces into small corners would be better.</p>Dual Track Motors That are Fixed<p><strong>Issue:</strong> There are two motors that drive the gantry. They need to be synchronized or they may torque and break the gantry. In addition, because all other electrical components move with the gantry, it is difficult to have extra wires extend to the fixed track motors mounted at the ends of the tracks.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A single track motor mounted to the gantry driving both sides would be better.</p>Extrusion Sizes<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The use of different extrusion sizes adds unnecessary complexity and little optimization.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> The use of a single size extrusion will be more simple.</p>Cross-Slide Plates<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The cross-slide needs a larger plate that is specialized to FarmBot's needs rather than the universal plate from OpenBuilds.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Custom plates will be designed to accommodate.</p>Eccentric Spacers and Number of Wheels<p><strong>Issue:</strong> We currently use four wheels at each interface, two with eccentric spacers for fine adjustment of the wheel spacing. This is both expensive and unnecessary. Many 3D printers using these components use a three wheel arrangement, with the single wheel utilizing an eccentric spacer.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Implementing tri-wheel designs will reduce cost and complexity. In addition, it may be possible to remove all eccentric spaces with the use of slots for adjustment.</p>Universal Tool Mount<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The original design places all tools on the tool head at once. This is cumbersome, heavy, and limited by space.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> A universal tool mounting system that makes a physical and electrical connection would be beneficial. A tool holder or bay would also be necessary to store the unused tooling.</p>Location of Seed Bays<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Genesis_V1_Seed_Injector.jpeg"><img alt="Genesis V1 Seed Injector.jpeg" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/2/2d/Genesis_V1_Seed_Injector.jpeg" width="150" height="199" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> The original location of the seed bays was mounted to the gantry with a motor to allow the bot to select the type of seed. This is unnecessary as the bot can utilized its X and Y movement to select from seed bays within its working area, rather than having an extra actuator.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> On large scale installations, the existing design may save travel time for the bot, but on a small scale system, because seeding does not happen often, a simpler design would be better. The seed bays may be mounted on the tool bay for increased modularity and one less required actuator.</p>Standardization of Screws and Component Sizes<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Utilizing as few different types of screws, washers, spacers, and other component sizes (extrusions included) will make installation and manufacturability easier.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Use as few types of components as possible, even if it is marginally less optimized.</p><h2>10-Month Environmental Damage</h2><p>FarmBot Genesis V1 was assembled and left standing in a backyard in the Central Coast of California for 10 months, excluding a Summer/Fall portion of the year. The results of the weather damage are summarized and shown in the gallery below.</p><ul>
<li>All screws from OpenBuilds (with the black finish) rusted significantly while the galvanized bolts from the hardware store showed no signs of corrosion</li><li>The tracks bowed out significantly as mentioned above, preventing the gantry from moving across</li><li>Black anodized plates from OpenBuilds changed from black to a bronze color on sides exposed to the sun</li><li>The tracks filled with dirt and dust, though it did not prevent the gantry from moving</li><li>The belts, pulleys, bearings, and wheels, remained in good working condition</li><li>The Z-axis and cross-slide became separated due to a lay-person grabbing the gantry and forcing it to move with the z-axis touching and dragging on the soil</li><li>Plant matter and spider webs covered many of the components, but did not seem to negatively impact it in any way</li><li>All extrusions and plates were in good condition</li></ul>

                                <div id="post-body-7499"><p><img src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/c/ce/Genesis_V2.JPG"></p><p>There are many design changes from <a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/FarmBot_Genesis_V1">Genesis V1</a> to V2 that make this version a huge improvement:</p><ul>
<li>Design and implementation of custom brackets and plates for greater strength and a more optimized design. These could be produced at home with a drill and a printout, a CNC router, waterjetting, or laser cutter</li><li>Endstop integration to let the microcontroller know when FarmBot is at the end of itself</li><li>Changed from looped belts to belt and pinion style movement for both the X and Y directions, allowing for simpler installation, less belt usage, and keeping all electronic components moving together with the gantry (no motors attached to the tracks)</li><li>Features synchronized belt movement along the tracks via a shaft and a single motor to drive both sides of the gantry</li><li>Began Universal Tool Mount integration with a door locker solenoid rather than all tools attached to the bot at once</li><li>Angled slots for wheel adjustments rather than expensive eccentric spacers</li><li>Z-axis leadscrew is positioned closer to the gantry for less induced torque on the cross-slide and wheels</li><li>Minimization of number of parts and simplification of them providing easier and faster assembly, accessible screw locations, and greater affordability</li></ul><h2>Tracks</h2>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Gantry_Plates_and_Endstops.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/3/34/Gantry_Plates_and_Endstops.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Rendering of the track mounting plates, gantry plate, and gantry endstops.<p>There were two major issues with V1 tracks:</p><ul>
<li>Buckling and shifting at the track joints</li><li>Incompatibility with orienting gantry wheels on the top and bottom of the track</li></ul><p>V2 tracks solve both of these issues by changing the orientation of the track pieces and the mounting bracket design. The brackets are larger and placed at the end of each track section so that one rigid bracket connects two extrusions. This keeps them from buckling or shifting, minimizes the number of brackets needed, allows for wheels to roll on the top and the bottom of the tracks, and allows for connection to a support post or another extrusion.</p><h2>Gantry</h2>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Gantry_Belt_and_Pinion_System.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/9/9e/Gantry_Belt_and_Pinion_System.JPG" width="400" height="177" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>V2 uses a belt and pinion style system to move the gantry along the tracks. The belt goes over the top of this pinion and then under each of the solid V-wheels at the tracks, and then to the end of the tracks where it is fastened. The motor also has a shaft going across the gantry to synchronize with an identical belt and pinion system on the other side.<p>The Gantry has seen significant change in V2. The most notable is the switch from a looped belt drive system that ran the full length of each track to a belt and pinion style system. Feeding the belt through the extrusions in V1 was hard for 1.5m length tracks and nearly impossible for 3m length tracks. The belt and pinion system uses half of the belt length and greatly simplifies installations and tightening of the belt. It also eliminates the need for pulleys and mounting plates at the end of the tracks.</p>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV2Plates.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/6/6f/GenesisV2Plates.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Genesis V2 prototype plates cut out of MDF with a CNC router<p>In addition, the belt and pinion system allows the drive motor to be positioned on the gantry, allowing it to move with the other electronics, thereby simplifying wiring as all electronics move together. Also, a single drive motor in combination with a driveshaft allows for synchronized movement between both sides of the gantry along each track.</p><p>The other major improvement is the use of custom brackets which greatly simplifies the construction while making the Gantry more rigid. In V2, 1 base bracket and 4 wheels at the track/gantry interface replaces the 1 extrusion, 3 brackets, and 8 wheels for this same interface in V1. The base plates also provide locations for the endstops to be mounted.</p><h2>Cross-Slide</h2>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Cross-Slide.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/1/1c/Cross-Slide.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Cross-slide endstops and belt and pinion drive system
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Cross-Slide2.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/4/46/Cross-Slide2.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Z-axis connection to the cross-slide and endstops</div><div><br><p>The Genesis V2 cross-slide saw a lot of improvement and change from V1. This version is constructed from three custom 3mm plates that have only the necessary holes to accommodate the needed hardware. The cross-slide moves along the gantry with a belt and pinion style drive system which saves on belt length, and is easier to install and tighten the belt. Endstops for the cross-slide and the z-axis are mounted onto the plates and are actuated by small plates that can be easily repositioned along the gantry for a different ending position. The leadscrew block for the z-axis is also mounted to one of the plates, which is hugely important because that block did not even exist in V1 hardware. The expensive eccentric spacers are replaced with angled slots for wheel adjustment and tightening. And the number of wheels for each axis of movement is reduced from four in V1 to three. Lastly, the Tee shaped plates are identical, making installation and manufacturing easier.</p><h2>Z-Axis</h2>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:GenesisV3leadscrewMoment.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/0/04/GenesisV3leadscrewMoment.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Weight of Z-axis torquing the Cross-Slide.<p>The Z-axis of Genesis V2 is not any different from V1 other than the fact that we actually assembled the leadscrew into a real prototype rather than just designing it in the computer. The leadscrew is an 8mm diameter ACME screw thread that connects to the cross-slide via a delrin block. The system is smooth and reliable and all components are available from <a href="http://openbuildspartstore.com/">OpenBuilds</a>.</p><p>Not shown in the renderings on this page but in the photo to the left is the delrin block being originally located far from the main gantry beam, attached onto the Tee shaped plate. This configuration created a large moment force on the cross-slide, attempting to torque it off of the main gantry beam. This torque can be seen in the photo to the left as the Z-axis becoming significantly angled. This configuration was modified so that the block is on the plate closer to the main gantry beam in order to reduce the induced moment force acting on the cross-slide by reducing the length of the moment arm the weight of the leadscrew was acting on.</p><h2>Universal Tool Mount System</h2>
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Universal_Tool_Mount.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/e/ee/Universal_Tool_Mount.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Universal Tool Mounting system
<p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Tool_Bay.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/1/1b/Tool_Bay.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><div>Tools can be interchanged and placed back into the tool bay</div><div><br><p>The Universal Tool Mount system was introduced in V2 hardware as a way to allow FarmBot to switch tools in an automated way so that it does not have to carry all of the tools at once. In addition, whichever tool is being used, generally has to be the "lowest" in Z-height so that it can reach the soil or plant. With all tools being mounted to the Z-Axis at the same time as in V1 hardware, all tools were competing to be the lowest. The Universal Tool Mount solves this issue.</p><p>The Universal Tool Mount system consists of five components:</p><ul>
<li>A 3D printed tool mount</li><li>A 3D printed (or modified PVC pipe) tool "blank" that can be filled with electronics, motors, or anything else that defines the tool</li><li>A solenoid operated "door locker" that locks a tool into place when inserted into the tool mount</li><li>Four sets of spring loaded 5mm screws that allow power and data to be passed between the tool mount and the tool</li><li>A "tool bay" that is a 3mm plate for unused tools to be stored on</li></ul><p>Using the FarmBot Web App, the user will define which tools are in which bays. FarmBot can then move to that position to pick up a tool, and load the necessary software "driver" to be properly use that tool. This system allows others to create new tools and drivers for any type of operation they can dream up, as long as it fits into the Tool Mount and incorporates the same four power and data screw configuration.</p><h2>Issues with V2 and Proposed Solutions</h2>Cable Management<p><strong>Issue:</strong> There is no way to manage cables and water tubing.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Integrate cable carriers or another solution.</p>Universal Tool Mount<p><strong>Issue:</strong> A few of the features are not optimized for 3D printing</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Avoid cliff hangers with tapers and chamfers</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Very little clearance between the screws that pass power and data</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Decrease screw size from 5mm to 3mm screws</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Tight fit of solenoid dead bolt in the tool mount hole, creating unnecessary tolerance requirements and friction</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Increase size of hole in the tool mount</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Tools are not inline with the leadscrew, creating a greater moment force on the Z-axis and Cross-Slide</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Flip the orientation of the Universal Tool Mount so that the solenoid locker and tool are switched</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Tool mount and tool are very tall</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Optimize the tool and mount to be shorter</p>Track Belts<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The track belts have an interference with the screws and tee nuts of the gantry corner brackets</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Reconfigure the gantry to accomodate</p>Endstops<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The small plates/brackets used to actuate the endstops are not necessary</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Replace these components with just a screw and a tee nut to reduce number of custom components. Reconfigure the endstops if needed</p>Cross-Slide<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The tee shaped brackets are not necessary and add complexity to the assembly of the cross slide</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Remove them and mount the endstops on the main cross-slide plate</p>Number of Screws<p><strong>Issue:</strong> There is an unnecessary number of screws holding the tracks together and the gantry together. This is more costly and increases assembly time significantly</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Reduce the number of screws</p><h2>3D CAD Files</h2><p>FarmBot Genesis V2 was designed natively in SolidWorks 2014.

The are generally the same design though.</p><p><strong>Issues and Proposed Solutions:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Using 4 screws to attach each track piece to each bracket is unnecessary and increases assembly time significantly. Using 2 screws will simplify the process and the reduce the number of parts while still being adequately strong enough for the application.</li><li>The mounting holes for the bracket to the vertical post are spaced apart by 40mm rather than 20mm. This means they cannot be mounted to 20x40mm extrusions. Spacing these holes closer together will allow a single type of extrusion to be used throughout the design. Also, currently there are 4 screws attaching the bracket to the vertical column. This is unnecessary so the plate will effectively be cut in half in V4 and only two screws used.</li></ul><h2>Gantry</h2><p>The Track/Gantry plates are slightly modified from V2 to re-position the endstops so that they can be clicked by screws and teenuts rather than small plates.</p>

</div></li></ul><p><strong>Issues and Proposed Solutions:</strong></p><ul>
<li>It is difficult to adjust the width of the gantry once the main beam is cut. One must either re-cut the main extrusion to be shorter, or have limited ability to extend the gantry width before the brackets no longer attach to the extrusion. Positioning the main beam such that it is not obstructed in length by any brackets would solve this.</li><li>The wire and trolley cable management system across the gantry will not work because the wires will get caught on taller plants. A cable carrier system will be cleaner and work better.</li></ul><h2>Cross-Slide</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:Cross-Slide-Genesis-V3.JPG"><img alt="Cross-Slide-Genesis-V3.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/6/6b/Cross-Slide-Genesis-V3.JPG" width="300" height="133" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>The Genesis V2 cross-slide was composed of three plates sandwiching all of the other components together. This was difficult to assemble and added little strength to the cross-slide. The V3 cross-slide has been simplified to a single plate with all components attached to it, making assembly much easier. There have also been extra slots added for cables to be cleanly routed through the plate and avoid all moving components.</p><p><strong>Issues and Proposed Solutions</strong></p><ul>
<li>There may be an issue with where the cables exit the cross-slide with the switch over to the cable carrier system from the wire and trolley system. This has yet to be determined in V4</li></ul><h2>Z-Axis</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:20140711_152405.jpg"><img alt="20140711 152405.jpg" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/2/2d/20140711_152405.jpg" width="180" height="240" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>The Z-axis motor mount has remained the same since V2.</p><p><strong>Issues and Proposed Solutions</strong></p><ul>
<li>It's pretty ugly and bulky and I can't figure out a way to make it better without a custom bent bracket. Likely a custom bracket or 3D printed part will be in V4.</li></ul><h2>Universal Tool Mount</h2><p><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:20140711_152307.jpg"><img alt="20140711 152307.jpg" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/8/89/20140711_152307.jpg" width="300" height="225" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle;"></a></p><p>The V3 Universal Tool mount has been vertically flipped so that the solenoid locker is on the right side and the tool is inserted on the left side. This allows for the tool to be more aligned with the z-axis leadscrew so that there is minimized induced torque from the tool's weight. The tool mount has also been optimized for printing with a 3D printer. It no longer has any overhanging edges, and no support materials is required. Lastly, the electrical contact screws have been decreased in size to 3mm to allow for more clearance between themselves.</p><p><strong>Issues and Proposed Solutions</strong></p><ul>
<li>The extra gusset on the back side is unnecessary. It adds to printing time and is difficult to get the screws to align with tee nuts once the main bracket is attached to the extrusion. This extra gusset will be removed in V4.</li><li>The slot for the solenoid locker to go through the plastic needs significantly more clearance to avoid friction. This slot will be increased in size in V4.</li><li>All screw holes need to be enlarged slightly to allow screws to easily pass through even with the slight manufacturing variations that are expected with the 3D printing process.</li><li>There may be significant difficulty inserting and removing tools and locking them in place due to friction forces, rough 3D printed surfaces, and tolerances. A more simple concept may be perform better.</li></ul><h2>Electronics</h2><ul>
<li>The power supply used in Genesis V1 through V3 is very large in size. A smaller form factor supply might suit the project better.</li><li>Electronics enclosures or housings need to be added to weatherproof everything.</li></ul><h2>Cable Management</h2><p>The trolley and wire system is a good concept, but it is best suited to larger scale installations. It should not be used along the gantry though in any circumstances as the cables will get in the way of the plants when hanging. For smaller systems such as FarmBot Genesis, a cable carrier system will be more attractive and function better for both along the gantry and the tracks. This will likely add cost, but would likely increase reliability.</p>

This simplifiction reduces the number of components and assembly time significantly. Additionally the plates are flat on the top and flush with the track extrusions, creating a cleaner aesthetic for tracks mounted to short posts as seen in the renderings. Also different from V3 is that the mounting holes for attaching to the post are 20mm apart rather than 40mm, allowing the plates to attach to 20x40mm extrusions.</p><p>Also new in V4 tracks is the use of a cable carrier/drag chain for cable management along the tracks. This is less visually and spatially impactful than the wire and trolley system introduced in V3 hardware. Though it will be more expensive, it is more suited to smaller FarmBots such as Geneses. A series of light duty bent metal brackets are in place along the tracks to support the cable carrier.</p><p>There is the possibility of moving the cable carrier to alongside the tracks as seen with the gantry's cable carrier. This would allow the elimination of the custom bent brackets in favor of using more affordable screws and teenuts for support. For this to work, the track connecting plates would need to be lower profile, allowing the top half of the track extrusions to accommodate screws and the cable carrier. This would not work in situations where the track supporting posts extended upwards as in the case of using fence posts or the studs of a greenhouse.</p><p>Lastly, the tool holder has been modified to accommodate the new tool design.</p>

</div></li></ul><h2>Gantry</h2><p>There are five changes to the V4 gantry from V3:</p><ol>
<li>The main beam is now attached to the front of the corner brackets rather than behind them. This change was so simple and minor but it greatly improves the design. This allows the user to slide on and off the cross-slide without detaching the main beam from the corner brackets. This is hugely important from an ease of assembly and maintenance perspective. The change also allows the gantry width to be adjusted more easily because the extrusion can be longer than necessary and hang off the edges. Lastly, this change allows the cross-slide to more fully move within the farm-able area, rather than being stopped prematurely by the corner brackets. Looking forward, the new design allows for an extended gantry to be implemented that is two extrusions wide or more.</li><li>The addition of a 3D printable housing for the gantry drive motor. It's fairly simple but should get the job done. There may be concerns with a 3D printed part being completely watertight, in which case a vaporized acetone process may be able to help, or an injection molded part may be used.</li><li>A cable carrier/drag chain is used for cable management instead of the wire and trolley system of V3. This is more aesthetically pleasing and prevents hanging wires and tubes from interfering with the plants.</li><li>The angled slots on the gantry/track plates have been reverted to plain holes and will use the eccentric spacers from OpenBuilds. The eccentric spacers were originally removed from the design because they were found to be so small that they would dig into the plates and wear them out. However, the OpenBuilds team has changed the design of them to be significantly larger, preventing this type of damage. They are still expensive at $2 per spacer, but they seem to provide a better experience for the user. Which design is better has yet to be determined but we figured we would try out the new spacers in this version.</li><li>The power supply has been removed from the gantry and placed at the end of the tracks in order to conserve space and weight on the gantry column.</li></ol>

</div></li></ul><h2>Cross-Slide</h2><p>There are three changes to the V4 cross-slide from V3:</p><ol>
<li>The motor is slightly re-positioned to support the 3D printed housing</li><li>The cross-slide plate is narrower to accomodate a 20x20mm Z-axis instead of the 20x40mm one in V3.</li><li>Extra holes have been added for a 3D printable bracket to support the cable carrier.</li></ol>

</div></li></ul><h2>Z-Axis</h2><ul>
<li>The Z-axis extrusion has been changed to a 20x20mm extrusion from a 20x40mm one in order to save space and weight</li><li>A custom 3D printable or bent sheet metal bracket has been designed to hold the Z-axis motor</li><li>A 3D printable motor housing has been added</li></ul>
<ul>

</div></li></ul>Issues and Proposed Solutions<ul>
<li>The 3D printed bracket is too weak at the points where the screws attach it to the extrusion. The print has the tendency to crack along the layers when screws are tightened. Increasing the thickness here and ensuring there is adequate clearance for the screw to fit in the hole will solve the issue.</li></ul><h2>Universal Tool Mount</h2><p>The V4 Universal Tool Mount has been completely redesigned to be actuator-less, simpler, smaller, 3D printable, and more affordable to produce. The primary mechanism for holding the tool in the mount is a pair of strong ring magnets, one on the tool and one on the mount, each held in with 5mm screws. Both the tool and the mount are tapered to allow easy coupling an de-coupling of the components.</p><p>In addition to the magnet holding screws, there are three additional pairs of screws in the tool and the mount that make physical contact when the tool and mount are coupled. These three screws, along with the magnet holding screws allow for power and data to be passed from the mount to the tools, with the magnet holding screw being ground. The three screws have springs between the heads and the mount, enforcing them to make consistent electrical contact. In addition, the three screws act as keys to prevent the tool from rotating undesirably in the mount.</p><p>FarmBot will use the Z-axis's leadscrew to have enough mechanical advantage to pull the mount off the tool when the tool is in the tool bay.</p>
<ul>
<li><div><a href="http://farmbot.cc/wiki/File:V4_UTM_1.JPG"><img alt="V4 UTM 1.JPG" src="http://farmbot.cc/mediawiki/images/5/58/V4_UTM_1.JPG" width="400" height="193" style="border-style: none; vertical-align: middle; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"></a>

</div></li></ul>Issues and Proposed Solutions<ul>
<li>The tool mount has a lot of unnecessary volume on the top half. This causes it to take much longer to print for very little added strength or utility. The V5 tool mount will be slimmed down</li><li>The body of the tool wants to make contact with the body of the mount at the same time the center screws want to make contact. Because tolerancing is not perfect, either the bodies contact or the screws do. If the bodies contact, then electrical connection is not made. If the screws contact, then the tool wobbles in the mount because of the small contact area.</li><li>The magnetic connection works extremely well, tools practically jump into the mount. However, there is likely not enough magnetic holding power for tools any heavier than the "blank" tool used for testing. Swapping which screws have magnets and which screws have springs could solve this and the above issue. The center screw can have a spring and no magnet, while the three outer screws have magnets. Contact of the bodies can be prevented with different clearance, ensuring electrical contact is always made, and with the 3 magnet design, a larger contact surface will be made preventing tool wobble. For lighter weight tools not needing 3 pairs of magnets, 3D printed spacers can replace the magnets on the tool.</li><li>The mounting flange should be made thicker for extra strength</li><li>Support material had to be added when printing the tool in order to support the second flange. This material was difficult to get out cleanly without damaging the rest of the part. Adding a chamfer will prevent the need for support material.</li></ul><h2>Electronics</h2><p>The power supply has been moved from the gantry to the tracks to save space and weight on the gantry.</p><h2>Manufacturing Files</h2><p>All of the plates can be CNC routed, laser cut, or waterjet cut and the motor housings, Universal Tool Mount, and Tool "Blanks" can be 3D printed. .STL and .DXF files for manufacturing can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-wExYzQcnp3Ym5fVl9KVVg4RVU&amp;authuser=0">here</a>.</p><h2>3D CAD Files</h2><p>FarmBot Genesis V4 was designed natively in SolidWorks 2014.

For those who don’t follow my usual antics, Farmbot is an opensource agricultural robot that aims to automate farming. I am a core contributor to the project and handle most of the web based stuff, occasionally taking a dive in to the hardware side of the project.</p><p>The question was a great opportunity for me to reflect on the decision to use skynet and think about the problems that we are attempting to solve. Here are my thoughts on the matter and why we ended up going using Skynet.</p><h2>Skynet</h2><p>Skynet is an internet-of-things platform that has been described as ‘device-to-device instant messaging’. It adds extra functionality to the <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT message protocol</a>, such as support for REST and Websockets. The servers are publicly available and open to all. You can register a device ID on the network by doing a simple HTTP POST request and receive JSON messages in seconds. Various modules have been written to support the platform on different hardware, including <a href="https://github.com/skynetim/skynet_firmware_arduino">Skynet OS</a> for arduino.</p><h2>Our Old Setup</h2><p>We were treating each Farmbot as a server that stored everything onboard and was manipulated via RESTful JSON interfaces. It was not the best way to tackle the problem. Trying to shoehorn a device to serve as a traditional REST API had a number of drawbacks including:</p><ul>
<li>Difficult to work around TCP port restrictions (firewalls, overly secure routers, port forwarding, etc)</li><li>Initial client setup was cumbersome.</li><li>Authentication / authorization needed to be setup from scratch.</li><li>Device software required many external dependencies, which would often cause problems during setup.</li><li>Running a full web server stack on a constrained device was resource intensive.</li><li>It was difficult to handle lost messages if the device went offline</li><li>Message delivery was not always guaranteed (see above).</li><li>The typical request-response cycle of HTTP was not always a good fit for our use case, especially for outbound messages or telemetry broadcasting.</li></ul><h2>Our Current Setup</h2><p>Our new setup treats all devices involved as API consumers of<br>Skynet. Almost all services plug in to Skynet as a client rather than a server. There is a soon-to-be-released web based component that allows the user to interact with the device in the browser directly (think <a href="http://www.farmville.com/">Farmville</a> for the real world). Background processes such as measuring weather data and watering plants are handled by a background job workers and a decision support system.</p><p>We made the change for a number of reasons:</p><ul>
<li>There is no need for us to proxy connections through our domain or handle cross domain security issues. All browsers connect to Skynet directly, alleviating strain on our web server. This means I don’t need to spend time dealing with CORS, JSONP or API proxying.</li><li>Guaranteed message delivery made intermittent connectivity less of a design concern.</li><li>Authentication responsibilities have been offloaded to Skynet, which lets us work on other features.</li><li>Using Websockets instead of REST means we never need to do polling for realtime events. HTTP polling is almost always a bad idea, so I was glad to have an alternative.</li><li>There is a REST API available if we need it (but we haven’t yet, aside from minor debugging).</li></ul><p>Although it’s been a good move for us and a step in the right<br>direction, there still have been some hurdles:</p><ul>
<li>The websocket API is heavily dependent on Socket.io. It’s easy to find adapters for webscoket clients in almost any language, but finding one that supports the Socket.io protocol has not been easy. Most Socket.io libraries in Ruby make the assumption that we are trying to act as a server, which is not the case for Farmbot. This has been our biggest pain point with the Skynet platform thusfar, as our socket client has been a bit fragile.</li><li>It’s a very ‘edge’ technology, and occasional quirks are found in the API, such as slight differences between the REST API and the Socket API.</li><li>We are still trying to find ways for non-technical users to deal with device discovery and ‘ownership’ when a new device enters Farmbot device enters Skynet. An LCD screen displaying the Skynet UUID seems to be the most prominent idea at the moment, but the decision has not been finalized.</li></ul></div>

                                <div id="post-body-9287"><p>We launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roryaronson/openfarm-learn-to-grow-anything">a Kickstarter campaign</a> for <a href="http://openfarm.cc/">OpenFarm</a>, a free and open database for farming and gardening knowledge! OpenFarm came out of the need for FarmBot to access structured, detailed data for how to grow a plant in a specific environment with specific growing practices.</p><p>We found that this data did not yet exist and figured the best way to obtain it was with a website where anyone could contribute the data, much like Wikipedia. We then figured that if we were to build such a database, it should not be exclusive for FarmBot users, but accessible by anyone via an API, open licensing, and a dedicated frontend interface.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roryaronson/openfarm-learn-to-grow-anything">Check out the campaign and help fund this project</a>!</p><p>//////////// From the Kickstarter Campaign:</p><p>Help us build the Wikipedia for farming and gardening!</p><h1>The Problem</h1><p>When searching for plant growing advice, it is common to run into the following situations:</p><ul>
<li>Advice is overly generic</li><li>Advice is not structured, written, nor formatted well</li><li>Advice is very specific, but not relevant to you or your garden</li><li>There is no way to discuss or contribute new advice</li></ul><h1>The OpenFarm Solution</h1><p><strong>OpenFarm</strong> is a free and open database for farming and gardening knowledge. Similar to Wikipedia, the data is free for everyone to access and anyone can contribute content. Because people grow plants differently based on environmental conditions and growing practices, OpenFarm provides a framework for everyone to share their story, and for learners to find the best, most relevant content.</p><p><strong>OpenFarm Growing Guides</strong> are structured stories for growing a specific plant with particular practices and environmental conditions. Below, is a mockup example of <em>Nancy's Guide</em> for growing <em>Heirloom Tomatoes</em> with o<em>rganic practices</em>, in a<em> greenhouse</em>. Below the image are descriptions for each of the sections of the guide.</p><img alt="Click here for a larger view of the image!" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/285/933/c7b03118db390878c6fe8159163cbaa8_large.png?1405455287" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; max-width: 620px;"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NzHBNOm.png">Click here for a larger view of the image!</a><br><p><em>See what the Growing Guides will look like on a smartphone <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YOzPAnL.png">here</a>.</em></p><p>In the example above, the<strong> Overview</strong> serves to introduce the reader to the guide by providing a photo of the plant at its maturity and a personal note from Nancy. There is also a table of contents for quickly jumping to another section.</p><p>Next is the <strong>Prerequisites</strong> section. Nancy has specified what prerequisites are required for her Guide, and based on the reader's OpenFarm profile a "Compatibility Score" is created. In the example above we see that Nancy's guide is 84% compatible with the reader and their garden because most of the prerequisites have green backgrounds, indicating that they are satisfied. Others have yellow and red backgrounds, indicating that they are not fully satisfied. Mouse-over tooltips show why each prerequisite was satisfied or not.</p><p>Following the Prerequisites section is the <strong>Timeline</strong>, allowing the reader to quickly see if it is the right time of year for them to grow the plant. The timeline is based on the reader's local weather history, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day">Growing Degree-Days</a> that the plant is projected to experience in that location.</p><p>If Prerequisites are met and it is the right time to grow the plant, the reader reaches the<strong>Growing Instructions</strong> which are organized by the plant's life stages. In Nancy's guide there are the <em>Prep</em>, <em>Sow</em>, <em>Germination, Seedling, Juvenile</em>, <em>Adult</em>, <em>Flowering</em>, and <em>Fruiting</em>stages. Within each stage Nancy specified what things she recommends to do, and when and how to do them. Some examples:</p><ul><li>During the <em>flowering</em> stage, <em>prune 30% </em>of<em> budding flowers</em>,<em> once</em>, <em>1 cm from the flower base</em>.</li><li>During the <em>juvenile</em> stage, <em>mulch 3 inches </em>of<em> straw</em> at the<em> base of the plant. </em></li><li>During the <em>adult </em>stage, <em>water</em> for <em>2 minutes per plant</em>, <em>with a</em><em> hose</em>, <em>6 inches from the rootstalk</em>, in the <em>early morning or late afternoon</em>.</li><li>During the <em>fruiting</em> stage, if you have a problem with <em>aphids</em>, <em>mist </em>the <em>entire plant</em> with an <em>organic insecticide</em> of your choosing.</li></ul><p>In addition to the Life Stages, an <em>Overview</em> informs the reader of what tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and other supplies are called for throughout the Guide. A <em>Summary</em> lists expected time commitment and water usage over the plant's life, and other cumulative figures.</p><p>The last section is the <strong>Forum</strong> where the community can discuss the Guide, ask questions, post photos, and share additional advice. Forum posts can be tagged, searched, filtered, and given the "Green Thumbs Up."</p><h1><strong>Searching for Guides</strong></h1><p>Individual Guides will not be relevant for everyone, therefore an unlimited number of guides can be created for each plant. Some will be similar while others may be tailored to very different environmental conditions, plant varieties, or growing styles.</p><p>When users search the OpenFarm database they will be shown a list of all Guides that match their search term, sorted by compatibility and rating. The search results may be filtered by sun-shade requirements, growing practices, soil types, and more.</p><p>Below is a mockup example search page for <em>Heirloom Tomatoes</em>.</p><img alt="Click here for a larger view of the image!" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/287/627/0adf669b2f177efe8a2843a4ff30d1d3_large.png?1405475094" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; max-width: 620px;"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NzHBNOm.png">Click here for a larger view of the image!</a><br><h1>Other Use Cases</h1><ul><li>OpenFarm is not just for edible plants! Growing Guides could be written for flowers, mosses, trees, vines, and other ornamentals. </li><li>Dirt not your thing? Growing Guides could be written for hydroponic and aeroponic growing, as well as for water plants.</li><li>Municipalities and organizations could use OpenFarm for habitat restoration projects.</li><li>Down the road we hope to build "Polycrop Guides" offering advice for growing a set of plants together.</li></ul><h1>Open Data and an API</h1><p>All of OpenFarm's data will be licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>, allowing everyone to:</p><p><strong>Share</strong> — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format; and</p><p><strong>Adapt</strong> — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.</p><p>In addition to openly licensing the data we are building a RESTful API for other applications or research projects.</p><h1>Where we are Today</h1><p>Today we have a barebones Ruby on Rails application built.

The champion will provide vision, coordination among project contributors, and be responsible for keeping the project on track and moving forward.</p><p>The remaining $1,500 will go towards reward fulfillment and Kickstarter fees. Any additional funds raised will be saved for future hosting fees and paid development time.</p><h1>Why Back OpenFarm</h1><p>OpenFarm is a small step towards a sustainable future. By sharing our knowledge in an accessible and relevant manner, we empower ourselves and each other to take action. Growing a garden, restoring native habitats, landscaping more efficiently, and understanding our relationship with the environment are critical steps in our journey moving forward. <strong>Help us build OpenFarm for everyone to enjoy!</strong></p><h1>Rewards</h1><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/292/797/6223c5b5749fd8f1153d14f866c9e68d_large.png?1405553956" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; max-width: 620px;"><h1>Follow OpenFarm</h1><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NzHBNOm.png"></a><a href="http://i.imgur.com/h0iMFLr.png"></a></p><ul><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/ZdLsj">Email Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenFarmDatabase">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenFarmCC">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/113214077035536673674/">Google+</a></li></ul></div>

                                <div id="post-body-9289"><p>One of our project's software contributors,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TimEvWw">Tim Evers</a>, just updated the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-raspberry-pi-controller">Raspberry Pi</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-arduino-controller">Arduino</a> codebases for FarmBot to support acceleration! Before these updates, FarmBot performed very abrupt movements because the software would drive the motors from standing to full speed and back to standing in an instant; there was no smooth acceleration function built in.</p><p>Now, the motors are ramped up to full speed and back down over a period of time. This is especially important for FarmBot because the motors are relatively small (NEMA 17) for the size and mass of the FarmBot gantry system. Before the update, the stepper motors would occasionally "miss steps" meaning that the microcontroller told the motor to turn, but there was too much opposing torque and so it did not in fact move as expected. This creates a situation where the microcontroller thinks FarmBot is in one location, when it is actually somewhere else. Subsequent movements could cause wasted water, damage to the machine, or the destruction of the plants - all bad!</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-21128"><p>This post was originally written on <a href="http://blog.openfarm.cc/2014/09/16/creating-and-running-a-successful-kickstarter-campaign-for-openfarm/" target="_blank">the OpenFarm Blog</a>.</p><p>In this post I&#x2019;m going review the entire process of creating and running the successful <a href="http://go.farmbot.it/blog/page/3/kck.st/1yBHkVG" target="_blank">OpenFarm Kickstarter campaign</a>. I&#x2019;ll cover what worked, what didn&#x2019;t, and what we would do different if we could do it all over again. I hope this helps inspire others to run their own campaigns, and inform them of what they should be thinking about and doing throughout the process.</p><h2>Intentions and Metrics of Success</h2><p>A common misconception is that crowdfunding is exclusively about the money &#x2013; that the total pledge amount on your campaign page is the only thing that matters. Though the money is obviously a very important <em>metric of success</em>, it is not the only one. There are many other factors that can make you and your idea succeed.</p><p>In order to define our metrics of success, we first<em> set out our intentions</em> for creating the crowdfunding campaign. <em>What is the purpose of creating the campaign? What do we want to achieve?</em> With the OpenFarm campaign, these were our intentions:</p><ol><li><strong>Raise Funds</strong> &#x2013; Our goal was to raise $7,500 in 30 days to pay for two things: website hosting fees and professional software development time</li><li><strong>Build Brand Awareness</strong> &#x2013; OpenFarm is a community based project built on crowdsourced information. Without awareness of the platform and brand, we would not have any users nor data to share with others. Therefore, raising awareness and building a following was an important intention.</li><li><strong>Attract Volunteers </strong>&#x2013; As a volunteer created project, we wanted to attract more volunteers to actually write <a href="https://github.com/FarmBot/openfarm">OpenFarm&#x2019;s code</a>.</li><li><strong>Gain Validation and Feedback</strong> &#x2013; Who wants to build something that nobody wants to use? By running a crowdfunding campaign, we were testing our idea with a wide swath of potential users. This is an excellent way to <em>validate</em> our ideas. Going hand in hand with validation is <em>feedback</em>. Aspects of our idea that would not have served our users have been reported to us as such. Additionally, we have had a flood of new ideas come in that we had never considered before.</li></ol><p>By setting out these intentions, it was easy to define our metrics of success:</p><ol><li><strong>Raise Funds</strong><ul><li>The total pledge amount on our campaign</li></ul></li><li><strong>Build Brand Awareness</strong><ul><li>The number and quality of social shares and interactions</li><li>The number of articles written about the project and their number and quality of readers</li></ul></li><li><strong>Attract Volunteers</strong><ul><li>Number of contributors and the quality and amount of their contributions on our code repository</li><li>Number and quality of other contributors (design, UX, data, etc) contacted through email</li><li>Number of &#x201C;watchers&#x201D; on our code repository</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gain Validation and Feedback</strong><ul><li>General sentiment of the project</li><li>Number and quality of feedback and new idea messages</li></ul></li></ol><p>With clear intentions and metrics of success defined, it was time to move forward in creating the campaign, starting with our communication strategy.</p><h2>Communicate Your Idea</h2><p>How we <em>communicate our idea</em> is the foundation for our campaign. <strong>This is absolutely the most important step we took before proceeding with anything else.</strong> Having consistent, simple, descriptive, and memorable ways of describing OpenFarm increased engagement, reduced the time and text required to share our idea, and streamlined all of our other communication efforts (video scripting, press releases, interviews, etc).</p><p>Below is how we, in general, communicated the idea of OpenFarm in various formats. Start thinking about these things now. Ask your friends for help and feedback. Write all your ideas down. Take breaks. Keep questioning what you come up with. Remember: <strong>Simple is always better.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>In 1 Paragraph &#x2013; </strong>OpenFarm is a free and open database for farming and gardening knowledge that anyone can contribute to. Think of it as the &#x201C;Wikipedia for Growing Plants.&#x201D; The main content on OpenFarm is <em>Growing Guides</em> &#x2013; instructional pages describing how to grow a plant based on specific environmental conditions and growing practices. Because everyone grows things differently, an unlimited number of Guides can be created for each plant, allowing learners to find the best, most relevant advice.</li><li><strong>In 1 Sentence</strong> &#x2013; OpenFarm is the &#x201C;Wikipedia for Growing Plants&#x201D;, allowing anyone to share their expertise and learn something new.</li><li><strong>In a Tagline</strong> &#x2013; Primary: <em>OpenFarm: </em><em>Learn to Grow Anything</em>. Secondary: <em>OpenFarm: </em><em>The Wikipedia for Farming and Gardening</em></li><li><strong>As a Hashtag</strong> &#x2013; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23openfarm&amp;src=typd" target="_blank"><em>#OpenFarm</em></a></li></ul><p>Some notes about your Hashtag:</p><ul><li>The absolute best thing you can use for your hashtag is your brand name. This is the easiest hashtag for others to remember to use and the easiest way for a reader looking at a post to go find your website and campaign through a search. Your brand as a hashtag also functions as a tool for you to gauge sentiment of your idea, see how many shares are happening, and where people are reading about your project.</li><li>If your brand does not work as a hashtag, think about it again. Are you sure it doesn&#x2019;t? Damn. Ok, then use something else that is short and sweet, simple and descriptive. Avoid the desire to use a really long hashtag. They are annoying, harder to read, less shareable, and take up valuable message space. Most people will make up long hashtags anyways to describe their take on your idea. This is great, but all of these random tags will not be linked in any way to your project and will dilute your brand and message. They are fine coming from other folks, not from you.</li><li>Using your tagline as a hashtag is a good option both as a backup if you can&#x2019;t use your brand or in addition to it. For example: <em>#OpenFarm is the #WikipediaForGardening</em>.</li><li>Avoid using multiple hashtags at the end of posts such as: <em>#OpenFarm is the #WikipediaForGardening. #Farming #Farmers #Gardening  #Gardeners #Plants #OpenSource #GrowFood #Kickstarter</em>. Let others do that. You should focus on your brand.</li></ul><h2>Write the Campaign Description</h2><p>Once the foundation of communication was defined, we started writing the campaign description. Here is the process we went through:</p><ol><li><strong>Draft a Project Description</strong> &#x2013; Just write everything you can think of at first. It might be good to start with an outline too.</li><li><strong>Include all the Details </strong>&#x2013; You are the expert of your project and it will be easy to gloss over details because they are so obvious to you. Have friends who are already acquainted with the project (but not an expert) read through your draft to help you make sure all of the right information is included.</li><li><strong>Simplify</strong> &#x2013; Now cut out all the fluff. Then cut out more. Rewrite sentences to be more concise and written in plain language. Boil your description down to convey the essence of your project. Make sure you maintain continuity. Remove as much jargon as you can. If you absolutely can&#x2019;t remove it, make sure you define the word ahead of time. Have your friends help you. Keep simplifying. Question every paragraph, every sentence, and every word. If it is not adding value, cut it out. Keep in mind who is going to be reading this -everyone: academics, kids, those with English as a second language, those without great vocabularies, those who are rushed and distracted, those who skim rad, news reporters and bloggers, your friends and family, and ultimately: <strong>people that you are trying to convince that your project is worth backing</strong>.</li><li><strong>Proofread</strong> &#x2013; Use a spell checker. Ensure you are using punctuation correctly. Be consistent with your styles (bullets, italics, bolding).</li></ol><h2>Create the Campaign Video</h2><p>When shooting the OpenFarm video, we wanted to include several things:</p><ul><li><strong>Context</strong> &#x2013; We started our video off in our garden. This showed that we are gardeners and therefore relate-able to the prospective backers, and also showed a use case of who might be wanting to use OpenFarm.</li><li><strong>The Problem</strong> &#x2013; We wanted to illustrate the need for OpenFarm and explain why it will be better than what currently exists. We did this quickly, not wanting to dwell for too long on the problem, but rather get straight to the solution.</li><li><strong>The Solution</strong> &#x2013; We spent most of our video&#x2019;s time on explaining the OpenFarm solution using screencasts to show what we want to build. Seeing something tangible gets people excited, but make sure that you do not fool people into thinking you have something that you don&#x2019;t! We made sure to put overlays on our screencasts to explicitly say that they are only design mockups.</li><li><strong>Short and Sweet</strong> &#x2013; Don&#x2019;t make your video too long! Be to the point, include the most relevant information, and make sure to ask for help. That is why you are on Kickstarter after all, so don&#x2019;t miss your chance to personally ask your audience for it!</li><li><strong>Production Matters</strong> &#x2013; Good videography and editing goes a long way in increasing legitimacy and &#x201C;selling&#x201D; your idea, but you don&#x2019;t need to go over the top. Spend the time to do a great job, but don&#x2019;t worry if it isn&#x2019;t perfect. In a few of the clips where I talk directly to the camera, you can hear a jackhammer in the background. I edited the audio levels to help reduce the noise, but I didn&#x2019;t go out of my way to re-record the clip.</li></ul><h2>Choosing and Pricing Rewards</h2><p>Almost everyone I know who has run a crowdfunding campaign has given me the same advice: <strong>Account for the cost of fulfilling rewards and the time it will take for you to fulfill them</strong>. Then add on extra for security! This piece of advice is what steered us to <strong>offer rewards at prices that allowed us to focus on our project</strong>. Of course, in some cases the rewards <em>are</em> the project, in which case a different reward model is needed. But for us, we wanted to end our campaign, fulfill rewards quickly at a low cost, and then get on with actually building OpenFarm and have a good amount of money to do it with. Our rewards:</p><ul><li><strong>$5 Digital Badge</strong> &#x2013; Easy and free to do. All we need to do is import all the emails into our badge system. Why did we choose $5 instead of $1 as our lowest pledge amount? Because 90% of people who can afford the time and money to give us $1, can give us $5. This small difference ended up making us an extra $4,304 because we had so many backers at this level, 1,076 to be exact.</li><li><strong>$25 Sticker</strong> &#x2013; Fairly easy and very low cost to do. Stickers and postage will be around $1, bringing in a high ratio of pledge money to the actual project. The biggest cost here will be the time, but exporting all the postal addresses and printing out labels will significantly streamline the process.</li><li><strong>$35 Thank You Note</strong> &#x2013; Still easy and low cost to do. Again the biggest cost will be the time, but estimating about 5 minutes to write each note, the extra $10 will bring in a lot for the project.</li><li><strong>$100 Tee Shirts</strong> &#x2013; Most projects price their shirts near $25. After buying the custom printed shirts and shipping them, this might only leave $5 or $10 for the project &#x2013; a low return. That is why our shirt was priced so high.</li><li>$1,000 and $2,500 for links and logos in the footer did not have any backers, though it is always important to put up a reward for a lot of money because you never know who is out there!</li><li>Overall, we did not have very many reward levels and each one was very easy and low cost to fulfill in comparison to the amount we would be taking home for the project. It is easy to add in rewards at a bunch of different levels but <strong>ultimately simplicity is the best road to go down</strong>. You will spend less time worrying about pricing, less time buying and making a bunch of different things, less time sending out surveys, less time making sure everything goes to the right person, backers will more quickly and easily choose a pledge, and you will be able to focus most on the project.</li></ul><h2>Supplementary Setup</h2><ul><li><strong>Build or Prep Your Website and Blog</strong> &#x2013; You must have a website and blog for your project. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be fancy, but it must be yours. If you want something simple, look into Tumblr or Blogger. If you want to get more advanced and customized, setup a WordPress site. Your website should include a blog to share updates with, your Kickstarter campaign&#x2019;s widget, your contact info, downloadable press releases and media kits, and of course: the normal info you would include about your project.</li><li><strong>Create Social Media Profiles</strong> &#x2013; Setup a Facebook Page and Twitter handle for your project. Add high quality profile pictures, descriptions, and cover photos, as well as a couple posts about what is happening so that it doesn&#x2019;t look like a desert. Make sure to invite your friends to like your page and follow a bunch of relevant people on Twitter. A Google+ Page may be useful if your project is geekier or more technical. An Instagram will be great if you are going to have a lot of good photos to share throughout and after your campaign.</li><li><strong>Setup an Email Newsletter</strong> &#x2013; You will be sending out email updates via Kickstarter during and after your campaign, but there are going to be a lot of people who do not back your project but want to stay in the loop, especially after the campaign. Use <a href="http://go.farmbot.it/blog/page/3/mailchimp.com" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> or another service to setup an email newsletter. Make sure to embed the signup form on your website and make it easily accessible. At the end of your Kickstarter campaign, you will want to export the email addresses of your backers and import them into your newsletter service to have a unified communication channel.</li></ul><p>Now that you are all setup, it is time to get ready to launch! The next two steps are things I did not do with OpenFarm but wished I would have had the time and knowledge to do so before hand. I am speaking now from speculation, not experience.</p><h2>Choose a Launch Date and Time</h2><p>With OpenFarm, we launched as soon as we were ready; basically as soon as the video uploaded. Do not do this. You want to get everything set up and choose a date to launch at least two weeks out in order to start doing groundwork with the press. You want to set a hard launch date and time so that the press can auto-publish an article right on time. Try to launch in the early morning (4am) so that folks waking up for the day and checking their social feeds and news blogs see your story first thing. They will then be bombarded by tons of other articles throughout the day.</p><h2>Befriend the Press</h2><p>The most effective way of getting the word out about your campaign is having established bloggers, news sites, and other projects write about and share your project on their website, social profiles, and email newsletters. These sites have large audiences who already like their curated content; they will be able to reach many more people than you ever could on your own. The key here is to do a lot of the press groundwork <strong>weeks, even months ahead of launching your campaign</strong>. Yes, you read that right. We did not do this for OpenFarm and then ended up playing catch up with the press with several articles actually came out after our campaign had already ended! Here is the recipe for success:</p><ol><li>Make a spreadsheet for tracking your press connections</li><li>Contact known writers or news tips email addresses and get your shoe in the door</li><li>Do not just send them a press release. Rather, mention that you read their site, follow their project, etc, and you think your campaign is something they might be interested in featuring</li><li>Make sure to include a press release, a media kit, your contact info, and most importantly: your campaign link and launch date</li><li>Be persistent but not spammy. If you start this process months ahead of time, you have the chance to reach out to multiple writers from a source if the first one does not respond. You and the writer will also have adequate time for an interview and to write about the project.</li><li>Make sure that their articles are scheduled to be published the day you launch</li><li>Make sure that they post their own article on their social profiles, and ask about an email newsletter.</li></ol><p>Take the time to find contacts and writers for sites with great audiences. The more suited the audience is to liking your idea, the more likely they will share the article, click your campaign link, and back you. Prioritize relationships with writers and look out for their interests. Their job is to cover great news like your campaign, but they don&#x2019;t want to be advertised at or spammed. Be cautious with your first connection email headlines and wording!</p><h2>Launch</h2><p>You&#x2019;re now ready to launch your campaign! Go for it and quickly move to the next step!</p><h2>Tell the World</h2>Facebook<p>Tell your friends on Facebook, ask them to share the post (not just like it). Post it from your project page too. If you are part of nay groups, post it there. You can try messaging other groups but if they are not following you, then your message will go into their &#x2018;other messages&#x2019; section and they will likely not see it. Also, it is unlikely that many people will see your post if you post on the wall of other popular pages.</p><p>In general, Facebook is best for connecting with your friends and anyone who reads an article about their project will share it with their friends. It is not so great and connecting with people you don&#x2019;t know.</p>Reddit<p>Reddit is a tricky place. If you have no experience with Reddit, you might just want to shy away from it. The good:</p><ul><li>Reddit users hang out in subreddits that are very specialized such as <a href="http://go.farmbot.it/blog/page/3/www.reddit.com/r/gardening/">r/Gardening</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/homesteading">r/Homesteading</a>. For this, each of these niche places is a goldmine of your exact demographic</li><li>Reddit drives a lot of clicks if you get upvoted and get to the top of a poplar subreddit. I mean, a LOT of clicks.</li><li>Reddit users will also likely comment and give both harsh feedback/skepticism, and great ideas and accolades</li></ul><p>The bad:</p><ul><li>There is a high likelihood that you will be auto-moderated out if you post the same link in too many places</li><li>You will not stand a chance if you create a new Reddit account and try to post</li><li>You will likely be down voted because you seem to be advertising</li></ul><p>With OpenFarm, we got an initial boost of traffic from Reddit. Then some posts didn&#x2019;t do so well and the auto-moderator stopped us from posting anymore. That pretty much ended our Reddit streak.</p>Twitter<p>Flood Twitter with retweets and favorites. Yep, anytime someone says anything good about your campaign, favorite and retweet it. If others come your Twitter page and see a lot of activity from a lot of people, it will be exciting. They may tweet themselves or find their favorite blog who tweeted about you and retweet them. Make sure to be looking at your brand hashtag and other tags that people may have used!</p><p>You can also use tools like <a href="https://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a> to schedule tweets. A lot of news sites do this and will send out a tweet about their article about you twice a day for the next two weeks. This is only worth doing if you had a lot of followers prior to your campaign, otherwise anyone who is following you has probably already seen your campaign and it is more important to share what others are saying about you and giving updates on your progress.</p><p>For the OpenFarm campaign, we followed and tweeted at a lot of people we thought would be interested. We found them by searching for &#x2018;Master Gardener&#x2019;. Anyone self proclaiming that title would surely be interested in our project. Here is an example mass-tweet format that worked really well for us and got a lot of engagement. Things to note: it is more honest and factual and less pitchy. We&#x2019;re letting someone know about something that we genuinely think they will be interested in. This tweet is also very retweet-able in the sense that the wording could come from anyone and it does not feel like an advertisement.</p><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/Master_Gardener">@Master_Gardener</a> A group of volunteers are building the &#x201C;Wikipedia for Gardening&#x201D; Thought you would be interested!<a href="http://t.co/BVfiCFV7qQ">http://t.co/BVfiCFV7qQ</a><br>&#x2014; OpenFarm (@OpenFarmCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenFarmCC/status/502312649279799296">August 21, 2014</a><br></blockquote><p>Here is an example mass-tweet that did not work very well for us. It is too much of a pitch and we&#x2019;re asking too many things of the reader: follow the link <em>and</em> retweet us. Too much to do for the average user and it feels too much like an advertisement.</p><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/therealdirt">@therealdirt</a> Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenFarmCC">@OpenFarmCC</a> &#x2013; the &#x201C;Wikipedia for Growing Plants&#x201D; on <a href="https://twitter.com/kickstarter">@Kickstarter</a>: <a href="http://t.co/BVfiCFV7qQ">http://t.co/BVfiCFV7qQ</a>Please retweet the project!<br>&#x2014; OpenFarm (@OpenFarmCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenFarmCC/status/502222171674910720">August 20, 2014</a><br></blockquote>Google+<p>Google+ has communities that function kind of like Reddit. You can join these communities and post about your project. Again, be non-spammy and try not to come off as an advertisement. Posting from your personal account might get you more engagement because you don&#x2019;t look like an ad, but rather a community member trying to share something interesting and valuable.</p><h2>Be Responsive</h2><p>Kickstarter will send you an email every time someone backs your project. This is fun for the first 50 backers and then just clogs your inbox. I setup a filter in Gmail to auto-archive the New Backer Alert emails so that I could focus on answering messages and comments.</p><p>Being responsive to the onslaught of emails, tweets, facebook messages, and Kickstarter comments and messages can be overwhelming when your project takes off. Take them one at a time and make sure to put thought into each response. Running a Kickstarter is no walk in the park &#x2013; you will need to be answering messages constantly.</p><p>Prioritize interviews over anything else. If someone wants to write about your project, help them along as fast as you can. If you can have a half day or 1 hour turn around to responding to interviews, you&#x2019;ll get a lot of additional press during your campaign. Expect writers to take at least a week to get something published upon first contacting you.</p><h2>Tracking The Campaign</h2><p>Kickstarter uses the <a href="http://bit.ly/">Bit.ly</a> URL shortening service that does two important things:</p><ol><li>Provides a nice short URL to share in emails and social media posts &#x2013; important for digestible reading</li><li>Tracks where users are coming from (referrals, geographic location) so that you can see where your efforts are most effective</li></ol><p>To access the Bit.ly dashboard where you can see this information, you must put a &#x2018;+&#x2019; in front of the shortlink, like so: <a href="http://kck.st/1yBHkVG+">kck.st/1yBHkVG+</a>.</p><p><a href="http://blog.openfarm.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bitlink-Share.jpg"><img src="http://blog.openfarm.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bitlink-Share-1024x1004.jpg" alt="Bitlink Share"></a></p><p>Kickstarter also has a really nice dashboard for tracking your campaign. They display: a graph of your funding progress, the average pledge amount, referral stats, video stats (plays and completions), and reward popularity. I found each of these areas insightful in their own ways:</p><ul><li>Our top referrers were:<ol><li>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/newsletters/weekly/286">Kickstarter Email Newsletter: Growing Things</a> (43% of pledges)</li><li>Direct traffic &#x2013; no referral information (27% of pledges)</li><li>Discovery on Kickstarter&#x2019;s site &#x2013; search, &#x201C;what&#x2019;s popular&#x201D;, &#x201C;discover&#x201D;, etc (14% of pledges)</li></ol></li><li>The overall referral breakdown was:<ul><li>58% from Kickstarter sources</li><li>42% from External sources</li></ul></li><li>The average pledge amount was $15.14</li><li>The video was played 24,755 times and completed 38% of the time</li><li>Our reward breakdown was:<ul><li>No reward &#x2013; 155 backers (10%), $1,660 raised (7%)</li><li>$5 Digital Badge &#x2013; 1076 backers (67%), $6,194 raised (25%)</li><li>$25 Sticker &#x2013; 230 backers (14%), $5,910 raised (24%)</li><li>$35 Handwritten Note &#x2013; 62 backers (4%), $2,274 raised (9%)</li><li>$100 T shirt &#x2013; 82 backers (5%), $8,255 (34%)</li><li>$1,000 Name and link in site footer &#x2013; none</li><li>$2,500 Logo in site footer &#x2013; none</li></ul></li></ul><p>It&#x2019;s important to note that 5% of the backers raised over a third of the money. This reinforces how important it is to reach the <em>right</em> people, not necessarily the most people. It is also interesting to see that for nearly every view of the video, we raised $1. So there is a bit of a numbers game in there about getting the most people possible to watch the video, assuming that if they click a link the are at least somewhat interested in the project.</p><p>Another important tool for tracking is <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a>. With this, you can get instantly notified as soon as an article or blog post is written about your campaign! This way, you can quickly go and tweet about that article or share it on Facebook.</p><h2>Share Updates</h2><p>It is of course important to keep your backers in the loop with constant communication. Share updates on your progress, be honest and up front about any setbacks, and build your community. All of the people who backed your project believe in you and your idea. Ask them for feedback, advice, additional resources like connections or knowledge.</p><h2>Fulfill Rewards</h2><p>Be smart about fulfilling rewards, stick to your schedule, and try your best to get everything sent out on-time, This is where simplicity of your rewards structure will be key, either making this part of your campaign fun and easy or a nightmare!</p><h2>So How Did We Do?</h2><p>Looking back at our <em>metrics of success</em>, we can evaluate how we did:</p><ol><li><strong>Raise Funds</strong> &#x2013; We reached over 323% of our goal from 1,605 backers! Pretty good, huh?</li><li><strong>Build Brand Awareness</strong> &#x2013; Just 3 days after the end of the campaign, we now have over 1,400 users registered on the OpenFarm site, several hundred followers on our social media profiles, over 400 subscribed to our mailchimp email newletter and we&#x2019;ll import the 1,605 addresses from our campaign, and we&#x2019;ll eventually have a bunch of folks wearing shirts and displaying stickers! On top of this, there is a steady stream of folks still finding out about OpenFarm from the already written press, driving over 2,000 pageviews a day!</li><li><strong>Attract Volunteers</strong> &#x2013; This was perhaps the biggest win of our campaign. Since launching we tripled our development team and have had a surge of discussion and development activity on <a href="https://github.com/FarmBot/openfarm">the repository</a>. Currently we&#x2019;re at 14 contributors, 43 watchers, 159 stargazers, and 40 forks!</li><li><strong>Gain Validation and Feedback</strong> &#x2013; We had a ton of great feedback throughout the campaign. I received over 100 direct emails with ideas, questions, and suggestions, 40 comments on the campaign, and about 60 messages on Kickstarter. In general, the sentiment was very positive both on the campaign and in the social media world. We think the OpenFarm concept has been very well validated!</li></ol><p>Overall, I&#x2019;m very happy with the way our campaign turned out and our team is excited to move forward on our project. I hope this blog post will give you some insight and help you run a successful campaign, good luck!</p></div>
