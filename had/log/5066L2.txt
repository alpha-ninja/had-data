                                <div id="post-body-17241"><p>Unfortunately, I do not have great pictures of this phase of the work.  I hope the few pics  we have get the message across.  The most obvious change is that we have added a roll cage.  There really is no fear of the car ever rolling.  However, this structure will give more stiffness across the vehicle.  It also gives us something additional to connect the body too....</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9457361430496055380.jpg"></p><p>The roll cage will not be on the 'production' vehicle.  It is very big, too big for the job it needs to do.  So, we will build a structure similar to this but less massive into the FRP (fiberglass) body.  This will in fact solve a lot of little issues we have been thinking about related to the best way to connect the production body &amp; chassis. </p><p>The other things you might notice are as follows.  Where I have the 2 red arrows pointing at the front of the car, we have added the 'crumple zone'.  These bits will be on the production car.  In simple terms, there bits will just be made from material that is not as strong as the rest of the chassis.  They will fail before the chassis fails.   </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/53051430496456279.jpg"></p><p>You can also see the 2 red circles.  These will be key mounting points for the body.    The fact that we have no engine in the engine bay opens up a world of possibilities for improved safety.  While 'empty' it will give us a lot  of luggage space but filled with a light 'structure' primarily made of foam, it can offer a lot of protection to car occupants.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2787401430500078273.jpg"></p><p>I hope the 3 arrows are visible in the pic above.  These are additional mounting points.  A crumple zone will also be added to the rear of this prototype &amp; the production chassis.  </p><p>The body is on in the 2 pic below &amp; you can see some of the points where body meets chassis.<br></p><p>We forgot to add the handbrake earlier.  Now, it has been added in a very 'rally' position.  It looks cool ! The interior can at best be called 'spartan' but, please note... 2 FULL LEATHER SEATS !..  Also the tiny orange button just beside the top of the hand brake..  We made this on our 3D printer.  This is the gear stick !.  You can choose between forward &amp; reverse ....It is possibly the smallest car gearstick in the world..  The seats are old MX5 Mark II seats that we got completely reconditioned.. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7315581430500699560.jpg"></p><p>In the final pic, you can see the seat belts &amp; more detail on the seats.  We had to think out of the box a little to get a seat belt assembly that worked.  We have welded bits on to the 'roll cage'.  The seat belt assembly is very secure &amp; really would (surprisingly) inspire confidence..  The structure separating the 2 seats is 30cm wide...  It is far too wide.  We have done our maths &amp; simulations &amp;, with the extra stiffness we will get building a cage structure into the fiberglass body, we can reduce this gap between the seats to 15cm.. This will make a huge difference to the sitting position of driver &amp; passenger.  The car has plenty of head room &amp; leg room for people who are 6 foot tall...  None of us are any taller than that !!..  But, once we get a taller person in the car we will let everyone how well they fit !.  The seats do move back &amp; forward so smaller people will be able to find a good driving position..</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8044851430501065534.jpg"></p><p>If you look carefully, you will see the head rests of the seats are perforated.  Both have speaker assemblies in them !.  This saves us the hassle of wondering where we will put the speakers.   They will be connected to the entertainment system in the control tablet.  The car will have all modern conveniences like Navigation, rear cameras for parking, full video recording of all forward driving, proximity sensors etc..  </p><p>The vehicle is perfectly drivable now. It is obviously better if it is dry outside.  You will see that we have no wheel arches &amp; more or less no floor is lots of places...  Why does it seem that the more work we do, the more work we have left to do???....   The car is ready for a range test now...  There are 'issues' with the back brakes rubbing quite badly but we will do the test even knowing the various problems....<br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-17292"><p>This is a bit technical but I will do my best to make it understandable.</p><p>When we drive the car over about 5 km per hour, it drives smoothly..  However, at start up, going from 0 to 5kmh, it is very uneven.  It really does not feel nice at all.</p><p>Different motor controllers send different signals to motors.  Some signals look like  traditional wave (sine wave). Other signals look like a 'block' (square waves)...  The motor responds to the signal it is sent..  When the motor receives a smooth sine wave, it behaves in a smooth manner.  When it gets a block, it can behave badly if the motor has not been designed to deal with thee blocks.....  To see if waves were causing our problem, we did some detailed analysis on the subject...  Details below..  <br></p><p>We used an old Rigol DS1052D oscilloscope to listen to the waves being send by the motor controller.</p><p>All the results can be found at the following link.</p><p><a href="http://shaddack.mauriceward.com/car-motor/" target="_blank">http://shaddack.mauriceward.com/car-motor/</a></p><p>There are sub directories png 4000, png 16000, png 64000.  They contain the measurements with picture width of a corresponding number of pixels.</p><p>The most important one is this :  meas 150408-182305, care engine left, phase 1 &amp; 2, very slow.</p><p>It contains the hard on- hard off nature of the switching.  This indicates that the control mode is closer to a stepper motor with no micro stepping. </p><p>A microstepping -like mode, where the switching of phases overlaps as seems to happen at higher speeds, would probably make its running more smooth at lower speeds. </p><p>The .txt files are text files with values &amp; with scope settings in the header.</p><p>The .wav files are direct scope readout, as-is, suitable for import to e.g. Audacity or other sound editor, for closer inspection of the curves.</p><p>All the above means we have a wee bit of a problem..  These particular controllers are not working especially well at low speeds with these particular motors.  We can make the issue less bad playing with the settings of the motor controller.  We can fix 'this' problem completely by investing in sine wave controllers.  But, they are (in general) expensive.  Also, sine wave controllers could open up other nasty cans of worms..</p><p>But, we do have motors from a different vendor.  &amp;, said vendor assures us that his motors like square waves...  We tend to believe him..  So, we will try his motors &amp; hopefully this problem will go away...</p><p>Unfortunately, the process for connecting every motor from every vendor is different.  We always have to draw up a 'connector' in 3D &amp; get it make.  It takes a bit of time...  I will post the drawings for the 'new' connector we made for the motors we 'hope' will like the square waves...  </p><p>More to follow in later project logs...<br></p></div>

The phone has a sport tracker app.  Below is  screenshot of the 'workout'. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9844131431164522293.png"></p><p>We put the body back on the completed chassis &amp; decided to give the car a quick range test.  The car looks pretty !</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9532481431004015584.jpg"></p><p>This picture gives some perspective about the size of the car compared to normal cars.  As you can see, it is not a small car.  It is long.  It is also exceptionally low to the ground for better aerodynamics. <br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7562811431004223142.jpg"></p><p> There were various 'known' problems before the range test.  The back brakes were rubbing quite badly.  There is still an open 'gap' where the front grill should be &amp; there are still no wheel arches &amp; more or less no floor.  Additionally, this test was carried out with 2 hub motors that are not very good.! <br></p><p>We conducted the test on a 'track' that was far from ideal.  This is a 1km route around 3 warehouses.  There are 4 hairpin bends.  As such, we had to slow down 4 times on each circuit &amp; accelerate heavily 4 times on each circuit.  Given the known problems, we were expecting a range of about 150km but we would have been happy enough with a range of 100km...  In the end, we achieved 206km...  We are exceptionally happy with this number.  We were driving for 5.5 hours nonstop..  Over the last 2 hours, we more or less 'trashed' the car, driving as fast as we could..  We all had other things to do that day &amp; we really had not planned for a 5.5 hours test.  So, in effect, we drove as hard as we could to try to get the battery to expire more quickly..!!</p><p>Many electric cars make no sound.  The LUKA EV sounds great..

There is also a nice graph showing the overall voltage.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-17606"><p>We found this document on line.  It is very heavy stuff, 188 pages long.  I guess someone got a mountain of money from the EU to make the document but as far as I know, no one has used it for anything real.  I contacted the authors &amp; they told me the research was 'public' so we can use it.  The document is slightly out of date (2012, I believe) but the majority of the info is still valid. </p><p><a href="http://www.transport-research.info/Upload/Documents/201402/20140204_140706_47375_Design_guidelines_for_new_concepts_of_ELTVs.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.transport-research.info/Upload/Documents/201402/20140204_140706_47375_Design_guidelines_for_new_concepts_of_ELTVs.pdf</a></p><p>If you have time, the research is well worth reading. Lots of info about different battery chemistry, in wheel hub motors, electric motors, position of batteries etc.  The research is especially useful for us because it is all about a 'future electric vehicle' with a weight of about 750 kilos (the weight of the LUKA EV).  So, in effect, lots of very clever people did a ton of research that we can apply directly to the LUKA EV.  We came across the research after the fact but it has helped us as it tends to put scientific facts behind a lot of our loose theories.</p><p>The bit we would like to explore in a lot more detail is in chapter 8.4 (starting page 140).  This section talks about a 'frontal add-on' to improve safety.  This is cheap &amp; light, mainly made from foam (&amp; we know a bit about foam as we initially cut the body shape from foam).  While the research looks at a (quite ugly) add on, we think we can incorporate something similar into the engine bay of the LUKA EV.  Our engine bay is empty because the engines are in the wheels..  Our theory is that we can have the front bumper 'out' while driving (possibly on a spring system).  The idea would be that if we hit a person at low speed, the bumper retracts so the person gets less injured.  Then, inside the engine bay, we have a structure similar to the one described in the research.  This is to protect the vehicle occupants in case of higher speed impacts.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have the time to look at these possible future safety features now.  All our focus now is on getting the vehicle approved for legal road use.  After that, we will focus on reliability &amp; performance while always keeping the car within its 'retail sales price' budget.  Only after we know the car is a 'good basic car' will we have time to look at cool stuff like making it one of the safest cars on the road.  It does strike us as odd that the current safety devices in cars (airbags) use explosives !.  There is something counter-intuitive about using explosives to improve safety !.</p><p>It would be excellent if someone from the hacker community could look into the possibilities (or if someone from this research group could take a LUKA EV &amp; build a 'frontal add-on'. </p><p>If anyone else knows of any other good external research, please let us know.  The idea is to regularly update this project log with any new stuff we come across....<br></p></div>

UPDATE.</p><p>On an English country road.... <br></p><iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ddkt2M6wKYg" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe><p>The car arrived safe...Just 2 days to go before the test. Still a fair amount of work to do ..<br></p><p>SATURDAY May 16th UPDATE..<br></p><p>The car was loaded on a truck to England Friday May 15th, late evening.  It will hopefully arrive to Stuart Mills (MEV UK)  on Tuesday &amp; he will attempt off  finish off the bits we had no time to do.  There was a lot of work to be done this week tidying 'everything'.  In addition, we did some big jobs.</p><p>We fabricated &amp; fitted wheel arches for the rear wheels.  This pic also shows how small &amp; neat the hub motor really is !.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7617091431873179767.jpg"></p><p>This is how the wheel arch looks form the inside.<br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8230001431873240853.jpg"></p><p>We also added a 'shield' between where the engine bay would usually be &amp; the driver/passenger compartment.  We mounted the electric fuse box &amp; the water container for the window washers on this. I think this pic shows how much luggage space we will eventually have in the 'engine bay'. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1388241431873464261.jpg"></p><p>The bits that remain to be done before the certification test on Friday May 22nd.</p><p>A.  Build a dashboard...  This is not to make it pretty, it is to cover what are deemed to be 'sharp edges'. The dashboard will be a curved piece on thin metal...</p><p>B.  Change the lock..  Only one door can be locked from the outside &amp; we put it on the passenger side by mistake.  The rules say it must be on the drivers side !. </p><p>C.  Window winders.  The window winding mechanism works well  but we need 'handles' that are stronger than we have today. </p><p>D.  Wipers..  We have shipped the wiper with the car.  We ran out of time.  Hopefully Stuart can fit them. </p><p>E.  Rubber seals..  We need to add these around the doors as this area is not completely airtight now.</p><p>We just hope the car arrives on time so there is enough time to do the jobs above.  </p><p>It is pretty much in the hands of the gods now..  I am sure we have forgotten something important but if e fail hopefully the list of things we fail on will not be too big.. <br></p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br></p><p>FRIDAY May 8th &gt;<br></p><p>We are on a very tight deadline &amp; we know that it can take up to 3 months to get a 'date' at the certification center in the UK...  So, we applied early...</p><p>We got a call saying there is an open slot on May 22nd.  Our car is far from ready but we decided to accept the date.  We are now working rather hard to get the car prepared.  As we are on the continent, the car will leave us on a truck this Friday....We really have a lot of work to do !.</p><p>Very few cars pass certification first time.  It is very likely that we will forget 'something' so not passing this certification test is the very likely result.  But, even that will be a good thing because the authority must give us a definitive list of all the items we fail on.  That list will be very valuable for us..  </p><p>More updates on this topic to follow.  We expect little sleep this week !. <br></p></div>

It raised some great questions.  The post &amp; our response are below.</p><p><em><strong>On 18 May 2015 at 13:40, Lee Hart via EV wrote:</strong></em></p><p><strong><em> &gt; There is hope for going 186 miles on 24 KWH ... the Solectria Sunrise &gt; went over 200 miles on a charge with its 26 KWH nimh pack on *many* &gt; occasions, and even exceeded 300 miles with James Worden hypermiling &gt; at the wheel.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This is true. A Sunrise prototype achieved 377 miles in the Tour de Sol. I should point out though that it was a specially prepared (read: </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>stripped-out</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>and highly optimized) prototype. So was the one that James Worden drove from Boston to New York (217mi), at speeds up to 65mph, with charge left over.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This makes it hard to say what the Sunrise's real world range was. Others may know, but I've seen reports of 150 and 200 miles, so I'm going to make an irresponsibly wild guess and say perhaps 180mi. That would give us 145 Wh/mi at drop-dead DOD. Curiously, this efficiency is pretty close to the</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>150 Wh/mi that quite a few Solectria Force (Geo Metro conversion) owners have reported.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This wouldn't be surprising. Their drivetrain was similar. The original Sunrise weighed a bit under 2300lb all up with battery. The Force's curb weight was close - 2100lb for the early model, 2450lb for the later one - even though it's a much smaller car.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>But the Sunrise had a big advantage over the Force in range. From what I can see, it came mostly from the fact that the Sunrise could carry a much bigger battery.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>A better comparison to the proposed Luka might be with Axel Krause's Mini- Evergreen. Although the Luka article is mum on dimensions, it looks to be closer in size to the two-place Mini-Evergreen than to the 5-place Sunrise.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em><a href="http://www.brusa.eu/en/development/applications/evergreen.html">http://www.brusa.eu/en/development/applications/evergreen.html</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The Mini-Evergreen had a range of 220km (almost 140mi) at a steady 65km/h</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>(40mph) round the Swiss countryside on an 18kWh battery. That's 129 Wh/mi.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Now where have I seen that number before? Oh yeah, that's what you get when you compute the (unproven, speculative) Wh/mi claimed for this Luka EV.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The Mini-Evergreen weighed 900kg (about 1985lb) including its 375kg (825lb) NiCd battery. Its aerodynamics couldn't have been anywhere close the Sunrise's slippery .17 CD, but looking at the photos of the Luka EV prototype, I'm not so sure that the Luka is much better. I'm no expert, but it looks to me like stylists had more to do with the Luka's shape than engineers.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The Luka is supposed to weigh 1660lb all up. (I assume that includes the battery, but ...) That's 16% less than the Evergreen. So if it hits all its goals, then it might indeed have a chance at their efficiency target.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>My question is, will they get there?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>I don't know what Solectria's total Sunrise budget was, but I know they got something over a million bucks up front from Boston Edison and DARPA, and they worked on the car for at least 4 years.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Lee Hart's effort to make the Sunrise into a kit car is a labor of love.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>I'm sure he's spent WAY less than Solectria did. But he's also been at it for about a decade now, and it looks like he still has a fair bit of work to go.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Compare those - 4+ years, 10+ years - with the goals for the Luka.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The article says nothing about the MW Motors budget, or where its funding comes from. It doesn't even tell us who's behind it, repeatedly and bizarrely attributing quotations to "MW Motors" and "the team leader." </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>(This</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>is a huge red flag, IMO.)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Regardless, whoever it is wants to dispatch the project in LESS THAN A YEAR.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>To me, that says they're going to be throwing bushel baskets of cash into labor and contract work. Where's the funding coming from? From whom? How stable is it? We don't know. The article carefully sidesteps those issues.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This makes me worry about a couple of things.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>One is that this might turn out to be another investor-trolling effort.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The other is that it's sincere, but will end up like hundreds of other similar ones. The money tree sheds its leaves, the staff are let go, the workshop goes quiet. The doors are locked on the unfinished project. </em></strong></p><p><strong><em> Bills</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>go unpaid. Eventually a court calls for the assets to be sold to pay part of the debts. All the work, materials, and good ideas scatter to the four winds.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Let's hope that neither of these scenarios happens here.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>David Roden - Akron, Ohio, USA</em></strong></p><em><strong>EVDL Administrator</strong><p>OUR RESPONSE.</p></em><p>David, <br>You have raised some great points. I am the 'owner' of the LUKA project so let me try to address everything. <br>The weight of the LUKA today is 741kg. (1634lbs). This includes the 2 battery packs. The bat pack is split in two for better weight distribution. The overall battery size is 19.2kwh. We have this smaller battery in this 'component testing' vehicle. <br>Will we get there? &gt; We will get somewhere. This is still a project, not a commercial venture. If nothing else, we will leave an 'open source' legacy. Others can leverage from plans, bills of materials etc. We may prove that it is possible to make a car 'street legal' on a budget. We may prove that hub motors can work or maybe add more weight to the argument that they really do not work well enough today. We might serial produce the car, we might mass produce the car. We might sell bits that are hard for people to make as a 'kit'. A small personal aim is that at least I will be driving a LUKA to work every day. <br>This is neither a marketing project nor a fantasy project. We are showing the project 'warts &amp; all' at hackaday. Hence some of the negative comments on the web from people who have not read all the project logs. What is on view at hackaday is a 'component testing' chassis. It has a specific purpose. To see if the body fits, to see where we will put all the components, to test all the components. The 'real' chassis will be similar but have the 'cage' built in, be treated, powder coated &amp; 'altered'. The 'car' you see in the pics &amp; videos is good enough to go for 'type approval'. It might pass. If it does not pass, we will get a list of things we need to change. These will be incorporated into the 'real' car. <br>About Range&gt; 300km is what we expect to achieve from the smaller bat pack. We are not scientists. We are also not going to do range tests the way car companies do them. We will just drive the car down a highway &amp; see how far it goes. We will measure the actual journey on a cell phone app &amp; post the results at hackaday. If our projections are wrong, they are wrong. <br>The reason we think we can get such a good range is because (we think) hub motors will have far less losses than a traditional electric engine. We have regen braking. The car is (as far as we know) very Aerodynamic. <br>The great points you raise are about ownership, budget etc. It never crossed my mind to write these things at hackaday but on reading your post I can see the 'red flag' issue as real. <br>I conceived the idea &amp; I am the financial backer of the project. There are no investors, no creditors (all components are paid for in advance) &amp; no full time employees. I own a company <a href="http://www.mauriceward.com" target="_blank">http://www.mauriceward.com</a> This medium side company was established in 1968 operates in 15 European countries. It has about 1000 employees. The people who have helped me with the project are 4 guys from the IT dept who work this project after hours... If you look at the videos, you will notice that most of the truck in the background are Maurice Ward trucks. The MW Motors logo has the same bi-plane as Maurice ward &amp; co.. There was no intention to hide who we are but this is not a Maurice Ward group project per say, it is me &amp; a few of the guys seeing what we can achieve after hours. <br>The 'budget' I have allocated to this is EUR100K. That has to cover all the tooling, the 'component testing' vehicle &amp; getting 2 x 'real' cars to e car tech Munich in October this year. That will be the official launch of the vehicle. We are well within that budget, even when we count the EUR7K or so we will need to pay for our little 20sqm stand at e car tech. I will be posting a spreadsheet at hackaday showing where &amp; how we spend the money. When we put the project on hackaday a short time ago, we really did not expect it would end up all over the internet. We very much thought a few people from the hacker community might see it.. <br>So, the EUR100K gets us to the end of phase 1. If we stop at the end of phase 1, I will have 3 x very cool electric cars &amp; the world will have a blueprint for how to build cheapish electric cars using hub motors. <br>If it looks like there is a demand for the car, we will look at serial / mass production. Any phase 2 would mean setting up a legal entity &amp; putting more money in.. But, we are in the unique position that we would not need investors, banks, debt etc. <br>The timeline of less than a year is really thanks to the internet. We are not really car experts. We have good experience with FRP. Within a few days of the idea being hatched &amp; us figuring our how to make the body, the serious question 'how are we gonna build a street legal chassis' was raised. Someone said 'just google 'chassis makers". We found MEV <a href="http://www.mevltd.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mevltd.co.uk/</a> in the UK &amp; Stuart (the owner) build the 'rolling chassis' based on our 3D drawing of the body. Stuart is now helping us with the type approval in the UK (he thinks the project is cool so is now like one of the crew, not a supplier). The rest of the build is really about 'supply chain'. Finding good suppliers of good parts that are within our budget. Having different people making the body &amp; chassis saved us a lot of time.. One Czech rally driver (Karel Trojan) <a href="http://www.kareltrojan.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kareltrojan.com/</a> has given us huge help with the 'driving experience' of the car. We are fortunate that between the 5 people on the team, we know a fair amount about electrics, electronics, control systmes, batteries &amp; 3D design. Stuart &amp; Karel have guided us on all the technical 'car' bits... <br>The staff will not be let go as there are none !. The investors will not get burned as there are none (just me). There are no creditors... <br>About the body shape... The car is loosely based on a prototype from Tatra that was never produced. Back in the day, Tatra were the kings of Aerodynamic design. <a href="http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2007/06/tatra-car-other-aerodynamic-marvels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2007/06/tatra-car-other-aerodynamic-marvels.html</a> ... We will not spend money trying to get a drag coefficient for the LUKA but we hope it is Aerodynamic. In terms of size, the car is L/W/H 4050 x 1620 x 1220 mm.. </p><p><br><br>I hope I have answered all your concerns?. I will post the same info to the hackaday site so there is no confusion.. If I have missed anything, please let me know</p><em></em><p>Update 19.05.2015..

The articles are good as those who have written then have clearly read the hackaday site.  A lot of the comments are strange, clearly made by folks who have not read the project on hackaday !..

The Luka is different because we have built it..  We will not be discussion the theory of this or that, we will be sharing the actual results as they happen..  </p><p>We did consider trying to reply to some of the comments but it really would take a lot of time !...<br><a href="http://insideevs.com/luka-ev-open-source-electric-car-hub-motors-186-miles-range-target-price-22445/"></a></p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br></p><p>13.05.2015<br></p><p>Possibly these topics do not belong in a project log but not sure where else to put them,  This project would not have been possible unless we had outside help from various parties.  We need to thank these parties...</p><p>Firstly, Stuart Mills, owner of Mills Extreme vehicles UK.  <a href="http://www.mevltd.co.uk/">http://www.mevltd.co.uk/</a></p><p>Stuart more or less designed the 'base' chassis for us.  Stuart has been building cool, street legal cars for years.  While we could have designed a chassis ourselves, the 'street legal' bit was beyond us.  Stuart has been a great help..  We will make major changes to the 'component testing chassis' so assembly to the body &amp; undercarriage are simple while retaining the 'street legal' essence of the overall design.  Stuart is now helping us with the certification that will happen in the UK later this month...  Please visit the MEV website &amp; check  out the very cool cars MEV build...</p><p>Next, Karel Trojan, owner of Korno Motorsport in the Czech Republic.  <a href="http://www.kareltrojan.com/">http://www.kareltrojan.com/</a></p><p>Karel is a fairly famous Rally driver.  His knowledge of 'everything' about cars has been invaluable.  While we were able to imagine most of the conceptual stuff, Karel was able to improve all our ideas.  He &amp; his team were also able to do work that we simply do not know how to do.  Finally, Karels knowledge about how a car is really supposed to handle &amp; drive is knowledge that none of us will ever have.. </p><p>Next, EISC Czech republic.  <a href="http://www.eisc.cz">www.eisc.cz</a></p><p>EISC is a tooling company with vast experience of 3D drawings &amp; fabricating metal parts.  They fabricated the motor mounts &amp; brackets for us free of charge &amp; also provided us with the solidworks drawings for these parts so we can open source then &amp; share them with the community..  EISC are advising us about all our solidworks drawings.  </p><p>Also, the LUKA EV seems to be getting quite a lot of Media attention.  With a google search, we found the following articles.  One is in Hungarian, 2 are in Dutch &amp; the rest in English.  </p><p><a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/open-source-project-hopes-to-offer-23000-ev-with-186-miles-range/" target="_blank">http://www.hybridcars.com/open-source-project-hopes-to-offer-23000-ev-with-186-miles-range</a><br></p><p><br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.groen7.nl/luka-ev-is-open-source-elektrische-auto/">http://www.groen7.nl/luka-ev-is-open-source-elektrische-auto/</a> <br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/05/20150511-luka.html">http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/05/20150511-luka.html</a> <br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gas2.org/2015/05/11/project-to-build-open-source-street-legal-ev-underway/">http://gas2.org/2015/05/11/project-to-build-open-source-street-legal-ev-underway/</a> <br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2015/05/11/luka-ev-project-visibletesla-app/">http://www.autoblog.com/2015/05/11/luka-ev-project-visibletesla-app/</a> <br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://hackaday.com/?s=luka+ev">http://hackaday.com/?s=luka+ev</a></p><p><a href="http://www.automotor.hu/hirek/luka-ev-az-elektromos-sportkocsi-amelyet-szabadidejeben-keszit-egy-barati-tarsasag-610936">http://www.automotor.hu/hirek/luka-ev-az-elektromos-sportkocsi-amelyet-szabadidejeben-keszit-egy-barati-tarsasag-610936</a></p><p><a href="http://www.automotivenl.com/nl/databases/nieuws/nieuws/item/6522-luka-ev-is-open-source-elektrische-auto">http://www.automotivenl.com/nl/databases/nieuws/nieuws/item/6522-luka-ev-is-open-source-elektrische-auto</a></p><p>If anyone else finds any media articles about the LUKA EV, please let us know &amp; we will post them here...<br><a href="http://www.automotor.hu/hirek/luka-ev-az-elektromos-sportkocsi-amelyet-szabadidejeben-keszit-egy-barati-tarsasag-610936"></a></p><p><br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://hackaday.com/?s=luka+ev"></a> </p></div>

We have been using the time to tune the car &amp; review 'everything' so we have the correct structure for serial production.  This is mind numbing work.  Making bills of material, communicating with vendors, tweaking designs etc.  We need to find supplier for most of the things we did ourselves.  We have to find 'real' parts to replace parts that we had lying around or bought second hand.  Our overall production plan is that we will get vendors to do as much work as possible.  We will then employ a team to QC check all parts, assemble the vehicle &amp; QC check the final vehicle.  The basic idea is that we will have vendors so well organized that we can build a car in 8 hours with a 2 man (or woman) team.  The fact that we have an actual car is really helping in discussions with suppliers.  They do behave differently when they see an actual street legal car.</p><p>The most important tweak to the test car was that we solved the 'square waves' issue.  We added sine wave motor controllers.  The car now performs perfectly at low speeds.  The power distribution is lovely, very smooth.  Acceleration is a lot better now.  We still have not gone over 100km/h due to the fact that we can not get the car on an actual road. We have made various other small improvements.  Navigation is working well now &amp; the front &amp; rear cameras are working.  There are some small issues with the BMS that we will look at this week.</p><p>If the registration comes through this week, we will take the car on the wave trophy. <a href="http://www.wavetrophy.com/en/wave-2015/">http://www.wavetrophy.com/en/wave-2015/</a></p><p>One of the stages is called the Kings stage.  It is 1100 kilometers from Berlin to Berne in 30 hours.  Seriously!.. We also have to climb mountains that are 2500m high.. If we get the reg number by Wednesday, we will go.  If not, we will have to forget about this till next year.</p><p>I am afraid the project log is a little boring but once we get the car on the road we should again be able to share interesting data like top sped, acceleration, a new range test etc...<br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-19361"><p>15th June 2015.</p><p>Unfortunately, we had to withdraw from the WAVE &amp; bring the car back to Czech.  The car is really low to the ground.  The night before we left, we welded metal plates below the battery pack. These were about 5cm below the chassis of the car.  This reduced our road clearance from 15cm to 10cm... 10cm road clearance was just jot enough !.  While driving on motorways &amp; 'A' roads was OK, we could not get through towns well.  We could not get the car over simple objects like speed ramps.  If we had taken it to an underground car park, we never would have got out again!..  It is a very simple thing to fix but it is something that must be fixed at home, not on a European road trip..  Here we are at the start of the WAVE.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3842571434359612824.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3254141434359724834.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/981031434359840600.jpg"></p><p>&amp; here are the official videos of Day 1 &amp; day 2 of the wave.</p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/w-AJRp7ASnE" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe></p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V8ZOQULOa9A" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe>The general public love this car!..  Everyone presumed that it was an old English or Italian sports car that we had converted.  It was difficult to explain to everyone that this is a new design, build at home from 'nothing'.  There was much head scratching going on as no one could find the engine !  The looked in the front, the looked in the rear but could see no engine.  Anyone who was knowledgeable about cars was shocked that 2 x 8kw motors hub motors could power a car.  They said things like 'so it only drives 10km per hour?'.... They simply did not believe that it could be possible to do highway driving with such low power...</p><p>The nicest thing was that the car made everyone smile !.  Cars on motorways drove beside us to wave at us.!</p><p>The overall performance of the car was amazing.  We had no range problems.  The car actually seems to go forever &amp; break the laws of physics.  This test car has the smaller 19.2Kwh battery pack.  We were driving relatively fast.  We had 2 heavy men in the car &amp; another 50kilos of luggage &amp; 'stuff'.  Based on day 1 (getting to the wave) &amp; day 2 (going Plauen-Zwickau-Chemnitz-Leipzig) the range of the car might be 400km?.. The BMS could be lying to us but we do not think so as our Voltage suggests the BMS is telling the truth.   But, over the coming weeks, we will do range &amp; speed tests.  Testing will be easy now that we can legally drive it on any road in Europe..</p><p>We were stopped by the police in Germany !.  We got a full interrogation ! They checked all our paperwork, the chassis numbers etc.  They wanted to see the engine number &amp; did not really know what to do when there was no engine in the engine bay !.  It is rare to be stopped by the German police &amp; for them not to be able to find 'something' so they can give you a penalty..  They just told us everything was in order..  I think we even saw then smiling at the car...  </p><p>The WAVE is NOT a holiday !.  It is all about schedules &amp; time keeping.  Each car has to arrive to each location at a specific time (like 0922hrs).  You must leave at a specific time like 0946hrs.  The organizers get angry if you are a minute late !.  The people are really nice, very helpful.  We stopped outside one town as we noticed our hazard lights were not working (Again).  Every wave car that passed us by stopped to ask if they could help us..(it took us about 20 minutes to identify &amp; fix the second problem with the hazard lights)   We will definitely take a 'real' LUKA EV on the wave next year....</p><p>We are pretty disappointed we had to withdraw so early.  We really wanted to do the Berlin to Bern stage (1100km).  With the apparent range of our car, we would have easily done this stage in the allotted time.  We would have loved to take the car up the ALPS..  This really would have tested the climbing ability of hub motors.  </p><p>On one hand, we are sad because the problem that stopped us had nothing to do with our technology or concept.  We just set the ride on the car far too low.  It was quite a basic error.  On the other hand, we are delighted that it was not a case that the hub motors failed, the motor controllers blew up or the battery pack only giving us a range of 20km..  The thing that stopped us was a simple problem that could have happened to any car, electric or ICE....</p><p>So, what comes next?...  Obviously, we will change the ride height.  We will also install the 2 x front motors so we have full 4 wheel drive.  With the current configuration, we can not reach our target speed of 130kmh. We get to about 120km/h but that is really pushing it.  With double the power, 130kmh should be comfortable.  2 more motors will also improve acceleration.  Today, acceleration is usually OK but not good in particular circumstances.  When stopped on a hill, the car struggles to get enough torque.</p><p>Overall, an amazing experience to drive all those kilometers using absolutely no petrol!.  </p><p>More updates next week.....<br></p><p>12th June 2015.</p><p>Today, we drove from Plzen (CZ) to Plauen (DE).  Total 167km.  When we arrived, the BMS showed that we had 63% of the battery not used !. So we used just 37%!///   It seems way too good to be true.  But, the Voltage also suggested the BMS info was correct.. It was HOT today !..Maybe 30 degrees...    We are at the wave trophy now.  We start tomorrow at 07.30 hrs.  Various activities during tomorrow including a race.</p><p>Tomorrow, we visit Chemnitz, Dresden &amp; end up in Leipzig.. Not much driving tomorrow, only  140km or so.   We have a hackaday flag with us so we will get some "hackaday" pics tomorrow.. </p><p>We had some small issues today. Indicators &amp; Hazard lights did not work.  We found &amp; fixed the loose wire.  Motor controllers were getting quite hot.  But battery &amp; hub motors stayed cool &amp; performed well.</p><p>Today was highway &amp; "A" road driving.  We drove about 90km/h on motorways &amp; probably about 70km/h on a roads.  We will probably increase speeds once the rally starts tomorrow. We have a lot more range confidence after today....</p><p>More tomorrow....</p><p>11t June 2015.<br></p><p>The LUKA EV is finally registered under plate no. LX15 GYY.  It seems we will be taking the car on a European tour starting tomorrow!  It is not 100% sure yet, still some details to work out with the organizers but we should be OK...  Assuming we go on the WAVE, the route looks like this.</p><p><a href="http://www.wavetrophy.com/en/wave-2015/route2015/">http://www.wavetrophy.com/en/wave-2015/route2015/</a></p><p>If anyone wants to see the car, just let us know &amp; we can tell you exactly where we will be at different times on different days....  </p><p>I will try to post daily with updates on performance etc....<br></p></div>
