Gas production is very fast after startup. The output hose is running into the flask so I know it's being produced and released. If I would leave the output hose clamped, the mixing process would cease after reaching the set pressure, and wait for demand.</p><p>Right now I just have a color dot for pressure settings I am testing with(green), which is 1.5 PSI. You can regulate a full range from 1 to 2.2 PSI with this regulator setup covering 1.8HP (1.5 PSI) -to about 4.5HP.</p><p>I have the output hose clamped on startup to prevent too much gas escaping on startup(normally connected to an engine) as this video was made in my shop due to bad weather.</p><p>The next feature to be added is the LCD display which will make the system more digital than analog(which it is now). It will also add some important safety features.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18302"><p>I have successfully got the tank system enclosed and really portable now. It was quite the chore, and can be seen in the three photos of the gallery. You can't miss it ,it's the big yellow thing. Here is a top view:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/884861432250176943.JPG"></p><p>The box I intentionally left taller than it needed to be for this first rendition for ample workspace inside, for modifications etc. In reality it can be lowered in height from its current 6 1/2 inches tall down to 5.</p><p>I also added a front tube compartment which holds spare dry fuel(the red tube), made the battery pack side access, and retained the manual pressure/flowmeter(the dial and pushbuttons) as this can be connected to different size engines and these require in different flow/delivery rates. Once the unit is fitted to a specific engine, a simple pot can replace these controls/dial, and can be set by engine size/demand.</p><p>The small LED display was also left in place till the new PCB gets made. It shows gas flow(bars) and reads fuel, low water, low chem.</p><p>The blue module(upper right) has the output hose to the generator/application and also provided is a syringe with a tube extension to manually start the tank running without a battery. This is a simple procedure. Fill the syringe with water, manually crank the stepper motor auger shaft a few times and inject the water.</p><p>This allows for plenty of run time, and when the generator starts, it will power the automated system. And external power input jack will be provided, so it can be DC powered (from a 12 gen output)or from a wall-wart on the generator AC.</p><p>The tubing shown will be changed later-this is for quick connect/disconnect and testing of the system to different engines.</p><p>I made a cutout for the cooling fan thinking it was a good idea to ventilate the box, and also force vent out any leaking gas(in the event of a hose/seal failure)</p><p>The box is fitted with a hydrogen sensor and a warning buzzer also.(just in case)</p><p>I plan on adding more cutouts to the final version of the box to hold an empty water bottle, maybe a few small tools???? or etc.(afterthoughts).</p><p>The reaction chamber drain/purge valve is located underneath.(ran out of photo space in the gallery, had lots more pictures)</p><p>Today I tested the tank and it performed perfect despite the ratty hand-wired circuit board(hoping to get the osh thing!) to replace it soon.</p><p>So it's slightly bigger than planned, at 10 inches X 11 inches X 6 1/2 inches tall.....But the weight is just over 5.9 lbs. That includes battery, spare fuel and everything. I am pleased so far. A gallon of gasoline weighs 6 pounds....by itself, not counting the container......A great accomplishment would be if this entire unit could be injection molded. It would be half the present weight and stronger than it is now. That process is really costly for startup though.</p><p>The carrying handle is just a piece of chrome pipe with a 1/4 20 rod through it and nuts on each side and is 3/8 inch round. Not fancy, but it is very nice now to grab it and go where you want.</p><p>I made a video of the test, running the output gas into a flask full of water, will figure out how to get that posted soon.</p><p>The box was made from lexan and plexi scraps and painted with available colors.</p><p>I still have to close in around the fuel fillers....Or I just may let it go for now. You can see the auger stepper motor down inside as well as the tank structure.</p><p>Operating instructions:(For big yellow box version)</p><p>1. Turn on power switch</p><p>2. Press red button to set fuel pressure for the engine being used.</p><p>That's it....The dial is actually a motorized pot and depending on the setting ,signals proportioning info to the controller. Pressing the red button increases flow/pressure to a max of 2 lbs. Pressing the black button decreases pressure.This adjustment will become a simple potentiometer on the next unit.</p><p>When you want to shut down fuel production, press the black button until pressure dial reads zero. No more hydrogen producing material will be used, and whatever remains in the tank will bleed off.</p><p>If the engine to be run is making use of the air cleaner adapter type, the fuel pressure control system can be used to vary the engines RPM. My custom engine adapters has a sharp cutoff built in that abruptly stops fuel from entering the adapter when the engine shuts down.</p><p>In either case, starting an engine on hydrogen fuel is very simple-One pull, and you are off and running.</p><p>I have managed through code to get a nice balance of just the right amount of chemical and water without "overproduction". It is helpful that generators and pumps run at a fairly consistent RPM making things a bit easier. Of course unless you starve the engine during shutdown to deplete what is left in the reaction chamber, it is normal to have a small amount of gas left over. This amount is so very tiny, it remains insignificant in the overall efficiency.</p><p>This mobile tank will hold 6 ounces of chemical yielding many hours of run time for a small generator. Very useful for recharging cordless tool batteries, flashlights, cell phones, small refrigerator and lighting etc.</p><p>I have began thinking of yet another safety feature. If it were ever to be the case that the fuel line from the tank would be disconnected(or forgotten to be connected in the first place) a free running sensor could be placed by some means to cease production.......I am going to mull that over for now.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18303"><p>I am today tinkering with making a framework which will hold both fuel tank and engine. I am going to attempt to make it as a vertical stacked unit, with tank on top and engine/gen on the bottom so as to keep the footprint small, and manpack portable. Going with a simple handle on it to start out with. It is very important that I keep the fuel tank ,fuel system, electronic, enclosure weight under 6 lbs.</p><p>The unit for this design contest is going to be a 1000 watt (maybe much less as I am so underfunded) total output, more of a highly portable demo unit.</p><p>For the first complete packaged system, I am going to use my custom home made engine(see other logs) and generator rather than buy an engine for the project, which I am unable to do at this time.</p><p>The stack will be about 10 inches square and about 22 inches tall. It will have a provision for a battery pack, spare fuel cylinders(tubes) for the dry chemical and a water bottle/tube(empty) for gathering water at the location of use. I am adding provisions so this can be started without a battery pack. A few turns of the auger, and a syringe directed through a small tube directly into the reaction chamber will produce enough gas to get the engine running and provide operating power.</p><p>The prototype will be as enclosed as much as possible around the tank and engine, with a flip out handle to easily move it around on site. I want to enclose it as much as possible so when used out in the elements, the system will remain dry and reliable. The best material I have for this frame prototype on hand is thick Lexan sheet, which I can cut up into strips and bond to form a framework, then use thinner material for an outer shell.</p><p>I am also on the hunt for more electronic components. The pressure sensors I am using now do not have a solid sourcing as I have had them for years and do not remember where I originally got them, and am sure better ones are available now. Hopefully T.I. or Mouser will have some selection, but that's for another day.</p><p>When everything gets mounted I will do some testing with configuration, troubleshoot and problems, and refine from there. I hope to swap out that rats nest circuitry with a fresh custom PCB.Fingers crossed!</p><p>Despite the fact this project is focused on the binary tank and fuel production, It is necessary to build it out into a fully functional product to demonstrate the precise control, and viability of the system. I will also be making several adapters for attaching this to a conventional off the shelf engine/generator, as outlined in another log.</p><p>The focus will be on providing remote power ,safety, reliability and to demonstrate the benefits of long term fuel storage(prepping), high mobility of the fuel component, and ease of use under difficult situations.</p><p>unnecessary in the final version as it will all be enclosed.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18304"><p>I wanted to do several testing methodologies in testing this fuel as a gasoline substitute. Being a machinist, I first produced my own custom made engine from castings made in my home foundry. I am not new to engine building so this was not an unusual activity.</p><p>I made a simple, single cylinder engine made to run on hydrogen fuel and tested output, emissions , consumption, and reliability running for extended periods of time, and after a few manageable problems was able to optimize the resultant engine into a reliable generator. Because of cash flow, I used an automobile alternator for testing instead of a traditional generator.</p><p>The second testing phase made use of a standard production conventional engine that I had around the house.....Yes....My lawnmower. It was an ugly looking mess, but it was temporary and necessary.</p><p>My lawnmower engine happily ran on my initial Mcguyverish aircleaner input mod, but tended to backfire a bit when the RPMs were greatly varied from high to low. This is workable in an emergency, as a generator runs pretty much at a preset level while working, and I further ran this long term(at much dismay from my neighbors) to test for any other bugs. This was satisfactory.</p><p>The real solution was to develop an adapter for specific fuel conversion, not unlike those used to convert engines to other fuels such as propane adapters for forklifts etc.</p><p>After a few days of tinkering, I was able to isolate the fuel air ratio mix for a consistent RPM range with a side effect of very easy starting, lower exhaust manifold temperatures and a much cleaner exhaust emission output. The right fuel to air mix ratio is important. Leaner mixes provide better emission, but reduce power. too rich, and backfires, and pre-ignition can occur. The great thing about microcontrollers is that they can precisely regulate exactly what is needed, and what works best.</p><p>It is useful to use a standard inline fuel filter to trap out any contaminates and or moisture from the fuel tank output, I have noticed some collected moisture running it on colder days. I like the small "stone" filters but they are getting scarce, but the standard one works good also. </p><p> It looks like I will be salvaging my old lawnmower engine for a demo unit as it will demonstrate the ease of converting a typical engine to hydrogen operation without making internal modifications.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18306"><p>The calcium hydride is a safe and stable substance capable of being stored for many decades in sealed containers. It has the consistency of sugar or salt, and slightly grayish in color.</p><p>These properties allow it to be metered and carried from the tank storage into the reaction chamber via a stepper driven auger. The stepper(nema 17) translates mechanically that a given number of steps and rotation of the auger thread moves a defined amount of chemical into the reaction chamber.</p><p>The water is pumped into the reaction chamber after the auger has stopped, and meters just enough water to make the reaction occur.</p><p>The process is controlled through a simple Microchip PIC controller, and receives feedback from the reaction chamber as to pressure demands, and maintains the process as long as demand exists.</p><p>The prototype was build from molds and cast as a two piece body. I hope to have it 3D printable, but I am not good enough at making STL files, nor do I own a 3D printer. The tank is able to be made from plastics as they are not affected by either chemical, and eliminates and worry of static, corrosion of leakage.</p><p>The construction of the tank was achieved by making molds for the upper and lower shells, filler necks and supports. It is my sincere wish to make the unit 3D printable, thus insuring they can be produced anywhere, by anyone, whenever needed. Unfortunately, I am not a STL file maker, nor do I own a 3d printer to make prototypes. At the present time I also cannot afford to pay someone to do this. It is my hope during the course of this event, that I can overcome and solve this obstacle.</p><p>The molds were poured using urethane based resins(should be 3D printed!) and fitted with barb connectors, O rings and sealant.</p><p>The auger was made using standard threaded rod fitted against the calcium hydride tank bottom, routing it to the reaction chamber through a clever threaded grommet for sealing. The water tank is fitted with a pump, like those used in a windshield washer system for a car, producing pumped "squirts".The pumps outputs is routed to the reaction chamber via a flexible hose.</p><p>A working pressure sensor is mounted to the reaction chamber tank, as well as a overlimit safety switch for shutting everything down. The reaction chamber is also fitted with a purge solenoid valve to flush the chamber automatically in case of overlimit pressure, and as routine dump of wastewater(lime water is the "leftovers from the reaction). The tank halves were then fitted together using O ring seals, and rtv sealant.</p><p>Using a Pic controller chip, the various elements of the tank are synchronized, and the pressure calibrated for the test engine. This is a very economical system as far as parts, but uses lots of crafted specialized castings(should be 3D printed!) and hoping to get it 3D printable soon...</p><p>The filler necks for adding water and chemical are unique. The water input neck has a wide opening and larger cap so a funnel is not necessary. The chemical filler has a small, long narrow tray and when withdrawn can have the dry chemical poured onto it and then inserted into place. This eliminates any confusion/mistakes that might occur to a new user in filling/refilling. The caps and filler necks are also color coded.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18307"><p>These are a few shots of my home made hydrogen adapters:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/911211432251746911.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6803761432251780358.jpg"></p><p>On the right is a typical lawn mower air cleaner assembly. On the left is the hydrogen adapter which mounts the same as the original. It is a simple tube inlet to the throat body with a mix screw to set the proportion air to fuel mix. It was necessary for the bottom plate to remain the same shape as the original as only one single screw holds both assemblies(original and hydrogen) to the engine. This adapter costs less than 5$ to make.</p><p>The side view shows the fuel inlet tube and the proportioning screw. You can note I had to offset these a bit as the original screw that holds all this in place goes down through the whole thing. That screw is located under my air cleaner assembly. This is a workable design and easy to make.</p><p>This is the custom adapter that I made for replacing the carb/gas tank normally found on horizontal shaft engines:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3554981432251838377.jpg"></p><p>You can see the flange that holds it to the engine block, as well as the throttle body assembly on the right. This was needed as the original plate is lost when you remove the carb, and without it the engine would run at max RPM all the time. This also has the advantage of when the lever is turned to full minimum setting the fuel is shut off from entering the engine. The barrel connectors shown are for the tank power connection, and from the engine generator. On the left is a 12 volt regulator (T03 case) which was required as the generator DC output is near 17 volts.</p><p>These adapters are relatively easy to make-about 40 minutes machine time from a casting if you are doing it by cranking hand wheels. CNC would be very quick.</p><p>The cost to make this part is about 25$.</p><p>I fussed with this adapter for some time until I finally got it right. Isn't that always the way....</p><p>Both adapters are greatly simplified as no pressure regulation is required, as it is done from the binary fuel tank. This eliminates costly regulators, valves etc. I will detail the construction of these later.</p></div>

There are two circuit boards right now connected with a bunch of wires and not connectorized. Parts scattered all over, with long jumpers......but it still works.</p><p>I have been fitting the tank onto a frame with a small engine/generator to finalize the packaging a bit. The fuel tank needs a power source of its own until the generator starts working, and right now am feeding it with dry cell batteries. It needs a 12 volt source, but current demands are under an amp. I am fitting the frame with a box that can hold any type of battery(dry cell pack, Sla etc). I also am making a provision to manually run a small bit a gas even without battery power to get the generator started and have it power the unit in auto mode.</p><p>Today I added another safety device, a temperature sensor monitor to the reaction chamber. It is normal for the reaction chamber temps to be around 125 degrees or so, and if higher could indicate a runaway auger or other malfunction. This will shut down gas production and sound a buzzer to demand attention. I also want to add a hydrogen sensor to detect any possible leaks from faulty hoses/connections, but cannot buy that right now. The led and other indicators will all be replaced with a lcd screen to query the system, and possibly adjust/monitor performance. A cooling fan was added to the electronics as shown in the photo to keep air circulating around the PCB as this is mounted near the engine in the prototype. This fan will be unnecessary in the final version as it will all be enclosed.</p><p> The new OSH sponsored boards have been built now and are ready to be installed. They will change much of the analog control system and convert it to digital control.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18346"><p>First, I got a recent quote for buying chemical for 250 pound quantity(Low for stuff like this) at 20$ per pound. This was an ingredient that would be tapped mid process from a manufacturer who would use it in a final product.</p><p>*** (Update:Since this log was originally written I have found 2 more sources cheaper than those shown above.)</p><p>I wanted a recent reference in case it comes up or is needed in the context of this contest. .....</p><p>The batch is 92%(that's really good) and is meshed to 20-Another good factor for conversion rate transfer. Smaller mesh grains dissolve better and more completely)This particular batch will yield approx. 26 cubic feet of gas per pound.</p><p>Based on that, the following chart demonstrates the cost for operation:</p><p>Cubic feet.......     ounces of material.....        cost in U.S.$per volume</p><p>____________________________________________</p><p>26...............................16.....................................                                    20</p><p>13.................................8.......................................                                     10</p><p>6.5...............................4.......................................                                      5</p><p>5.1........................................................................................6 hrs run</p><p>4.8..............................                              3.......................................                                      3.75</p><p>3.3..............................                              2.......................................                                      2.5</p><p> There are always some losses, when shutting down, when starting up, air/fuel mix differences etc. A  F/A air mix of around 30:1 is typical. It is to be assumed water for the process is available for free.</p><p>Hydrogen test</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>According to the flow rate data during the 6 hour test, the engine consumed somewhere between 3 and 4 ounces of material. The flow rate meter readings showed 5.1 cubic feet. Produced hydrogen flow(in cubic feet) is always what was measured-Not what is put in the tank in the form of chemical. It works out pretty close though-I closely monitor how much I am using for everything.</p><p>I have the specs for each grade by doing batch samples to get the volume of gas per pound before anything else is done.  </p><p>I also can never really ever completely get all the chemical out of the tank without tearing it apart(auger holds some). So during tests/runs I just make sure an ample supply exists before starting them.</p><p>So the relationship is 5.1 cubic feet used for the 6 hour test- This is going to translate someplace between 3 and 4 ounces(again....Close as I can get), thus costing(at least for this batch $4.50? to 4.75 just to be well covered..</p><p>Running the same engine on gasoline</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Part 2. The gasoline generator-The standard gasoline engine with generator running straight from the factory consumed 1 gallon of gasoline running the same amount of time.</p><p>At todays gas price($2.55) gasoline is cheaper(actually by far....well at least for now). Buying high volume chemical quantities can reduce this number way down of course.</p><p>The off the shelf generator is 900 watt max, 700 rated and working at 350 watt load(again-give or take a tick) With  gasoline fuel that's about 60% throttle, and 75% for the hydrogen engine.</p><p>The great thing about the hydrogen fuel-I can store it forever, and only make exactly what the engine needs to perform a given task. Storage is neat and compact and ready whenever it is needed. Gasoline is lucky if it stays fresh more than a few months.</p><p>This is also why(in my opinion), even at elevated costs for chemical using the binary fuel tank it still makes sense in the context of this project and objectives.</p></div>

I wired the kill switch to the front panel, and have the throttle pushed wide open for hydrogen use as the RPMs are controlled by the fuel flow regulated by the hydrogen supply. The engine is performing perfect. The rig is not perfect but proves the versatility of the hydrogen fuel.</p><p> I am testing and logging performance results right now, and a video of overall operation is coming soon.</p><p>My next goal is to improve the fuel adapter by making it interactive with the binary fuel tank, which will include safety features such as engine shutoff, leak sensing and throttle control.</p></div>
