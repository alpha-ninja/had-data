I wanted to develop a system that could be scaled to use any size of roller chain, but I decided to focus my prototyping on the sizes that would be most useful. For very small tracked applications, tracks less than 1" wide, there were several options and the cost was small enough that using a continuous belt system was an option. On the other side of the spectrum very few people are building full size tank projects or construction vehicles and if you are then you probably have the money or demand to work with currently available solutions. My design will be scalable from the tiny to extremely large, but it makes sense to focus on the middles size.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1469341433349431609.JPG" style="width: 346px; height: 259.144032921811px;"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6789361433349968911.JPG" style="width: 340px; height: 255.290102389079px;"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1250961433350147235.JPG" style="width: 387px; height: 290.076923076923px;"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9934731433350196168.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2022931433350255454.JPG"></p><p>I started by making some 3d models of roller chain and 3d printing the links. I also made a few first designs of a tread link which would connect the roller chain. I was focusing on #35, #40 and #50 roller chain sizes. My idea was to break the roller chain links using a chain breaker and connect the links to the treads with the closest size bolts that would fit.</p><p>After 3d printing a few parts I quickly realized the #50 chain resulted in a larger track system than I expected. 3d printing big parts takes longer and uses more plastic, so I narrowed my prototyping to only #35 and #40 chain. </p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18885"><p>Over the next few days I continued 3d printing parts and assembling them with left over bolts from other projects. While parts were printing I continued to research tracked systems and try to learn from the designs on excavation equipment and actual tanks. It was quite interesting to see how military vehicles evolved the track systems and how they were quite different from construction vehicles.</p><p>I was hoping to find some details on the actual tread profiles used. It seemed to me that the design of the tread should be fairly standardized and that depending on application you should be able to copy a commonly used tread profile. However, I was not able to find any great documentation on this. Knew that I could develop several different tread profiles in the long run, but for initial prototyping I wanted to come up with a tread profile that would work well on a wide range of surfaces. I was able to piece together some useful information and separate tread profiles into 3 categories.</p><p>Grousers:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3393221433349076248.jpg"></p><p>A grouser is basically just a metal blade that is bolted onto the track. It is used mainly on construction vehicles such as a bulldozer. The offer extreme traction on soft surfaces when going forward or backward, with the tradeoff of being hard to turn. They also tear up the ground and do not work very well on hard surfaces such as roads. These are great for specific situations, but not idea for a generic tread profile.</p><p>Pads:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/134601433349100621.jpg"></p><p>I was surprised to find that most tanks actually had flat pads on the treads. Sometimes it was one pad that was the whole width of the track and other times it was two alternating pads. Most of the examples I found showed the pads to be flat without any texture. When I really thought about it, tanks actually drive on dirt roads quite often. While they need be able to go off-roading, they also need to be able to keep up with convoys which would often be on dirt roads.</p><p>Other</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4827211433349140937.jpg"></p><p>This is really just a catch all for the other tread profiles I saw. Most of these are from construction vehicles, snow blowers and snow mobiles. Almost all of these are molded rubber belts that may have some bands inside for added strength. Since the belt is molded the tread profile can be made to be almost anything. They typically have some profile sticking up with blunted tips, and a taper. Some have smooth tops, other have textures. Some have a profile that is the width of the track, and others have some alternating pattern. I could not find much detail about the connections between the profile shape and how it performed on various surfaces.</p><p>A few other notes</p><p>Turning:</p><p>I did find some details about the taper on the sides of the profiles. When tracked vehicles turn the tracks actually slide sideways. Having a taper on the sides of the profile helps the track slide and makes it easier to turn.</p><p>V shaped profiles:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9930621433349120738.jpg"></p><p>I saw quite a few profiles that had a V shaped profile. From what I could find this is helpful for muddy conditions. If the tracks are slipping because they are on a very soft surface such as gravel or mud the V shaped profile pushes the material out from under the tracks. As the track slips the mud is pushed out the side of the profile and then the tracks can grip on firmer material below the mud. However, this V shape makes the track one directional and it means that it works better driving forward than it does driving in reverse. Since turning means you are driving one track in reverse, this also means that V shaped profiles are not as good at turning.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18886"><p>Based on this research I decided that grousers and V shaped profiles were not ideal for an all-purpose tread profile. Maybe down the road I can develop additional profiles for specialized applications.</p><p>Based on this research I 3d printed several profiles and over time refined the profile until I was happy with a profile that was similar to a generic construction vehicle profile. I added generous tapers on the sides to make something that would turn easily, and hopefully not tear up my yard when I drove it around.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9174251433350340307.JPG"></p><p>At this point I was finally getting enough parts to see how the links interacted with each other. I started to notice that the design only allowed the links to bend in one direction. Initially I didn't think that the tracks would need to back-bend. Since I had never seen tracks that went over a one sprocket and under another. This is very common in roller chain however. I designed the treads such that when the track was straight there would be very little gap between tracks. However, when I started prototyping the parts I noticed that when driving over objects having some back-bending is needed. Without it, the vehicle will see-saw over even small obstacles which will reduce the amount of track that is actually in </p><p>contact with the ground.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5830491433350355597.JPG"></p><p>I started to revise the design and adjust the gap between treads to allow for some back-bending while trying to keep the gaps between treads as small as possible. This is where having a 3d printer is wonderful. I was able to 3d print various designs and connect them together to investigate this back-bending. I could simulate this in my 3d modeling software, SolidWorks, but it was not very convenient and it did not simulate any flexing of the parts. 3D modeling is amazing and lets you simulate a lot of designs, but then you need to build the prototype and hold it in your hands. 3D printed parts is the next step.<br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6490401433350392955.JPG"></p><p>After integrating the design several times I decided that using 3d printed links for the chain did not simulate the final design well enough. The tolerances of the printer were not as tight as chain, and the plastic parts had too much flex. It was time to order some chain and upgrade. I ordered some #20, #35, and #40 chain on amazon. When it arrived I was surprised by how tiny the #20 chain was. This is another drawback of 3d modeling. You can get a feel for the scale of things in relation to each other, but not in relation to the world. I was working with parametric parts that scale from tiny to huge. But when I looked at them on the screen I never got that sense.<br></p><p><span></span></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3974121433350454870.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6946331433350461079.JPG"></p><br><p>I started to disassemble the chain. My previous experience with breaking chain was pretty limited. Most times I only had to break a few links to change the length of the chain. I knew that breaking a large amount of chain would not be fun, but I also knew that this would only be for prototyping. I could build a robot to break chain in a larger scale or better yet find a supplier of unassembled chain. I originally thought that the pins would just be pressed in and need to be pressed out. However, the heads of the pins were domed and that made it much harder. I tried a few different methods to break the chain. First I used a dremal with a sanding wheel to remove the heads of the pins, and then I used a punch and vice to knock the pins out. This worked well, but was not very fast. Next I used the vertical mill. I put the chain in the vice and milled the heads of the pins off. This worked well, but without a custom fixture the chain did not sit perfectly. This way you could only mill about 8 links before the chain was either too high or too low and the height needed to be adjusted. It was not too bad and if I had to do it in larger scale I would make some custom vice jaws that held the chain better, or maybe even some 4th axis that could feed the chain through. This was a fun idea to think about, but a tangent project that could have easily side tracked me.</p><p>Once I had broken enough chain I replaced the 3d printed chain parts. The design was really starting to become a reality. It no longer felt like a cheap plastic toy, but had some weight to it. With the metal chain the links moved much smoother. My plastic parts fit together much tighter. I also noticed that the size of the holes on the chain did not match standard bolts as well as I hoped. For #35 chain a #6 machine screw fit well, but the other size chain did not match as well as I hoped. I could use metric screws for some sizes, but that was not ideal. Mixing imperial and metric in the same project was messy.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18887"><p>Now that I had the chain and the design seemed to work well I started to investigate how I would manufacture these parts in larger quantities. 3d printed treads would never be cost effective and breaking chain by hand wouldn't be either. I was at the point in the product where I had a proof of concept and needed to think about taking it to the next level. I needed to think about designing for manufacturing. I wanted to keep the design as cost effective as possible and that means really understanding the manufacturing process. Parts that are designed with a good understanding of how they will be made, end up being cheaper. </p><p>Since the roller chain is an off the shelf component there is little design for manufacturing that I could do with it. Cost will come down to what I can get from a supplier, and if they will sell the parts in the manner I want. </p><p>However, the tread will most likely be injection molded. So I took a look at the design and I uploaded the model to protomolds website for a quick check. They have a nice auto-quoting system that will give you a ballpark cost and is really good at comparing design changes. It also will highlight areas of your model that need draft angles or will result in sink marks or warping. I have made a few injection molded parts, but I am far from an expert at it. So getting this kind of feedback is really helpful. </p><p>I dont often order parts from protomold because the cost is typically to high for my low volume projects, and high volume things I tend to find a cheaper supplier if you look around.  Another issues is that protomold will not do any overmolding. For this part I had intended to injection mold around a threaded stud. I started to look at the cost of these studs and I just could not find a supplier that could sell them cheap enough. I think the best I could find was around $0.30 a stud. Which means that I have $0.60 in each tread piece. The other problem was that for 35 chain the threaded stud would match the holes in the chain well. But for the other sizes of chain I could not find a threaded stud that matched as well. </p><p>I also didn't like the idea that my design would not be scaleable. I really want a design that could work for all standard size chain. So I went back to the drawing board and thought that I could maybe find a dowel pin with snap ring grooves at each end. This is sometimes called a headless pin, or headless pin with grooves. Below is a photo of one.</p><p><img src="http://fastening-solutions.pivotpins.com/ImgMedium/headless-pin-grooved.jpg">I thought that this would be a good option because it could be cheaper than a threaded stud, and snap rings would be much cheaper than nylock nuts. They would require a special tool to install but that might not be bad. So I started to look around for these and even called a few places to ask them about it. I could not find anyone that made a pin that would work for my need. I even found a few places that specialize in making this kind of pin and asked them to quote a custom pin for me. But they said it was too small for what they did. </p><p>Next I sent out the quote to a few companies that have a Swiss Style Lathe. These are special lathes that work on parts that the length is many times the diameter of the parts. I got a few quotes back at around $1.30 a pin. Even in large quantities this was not gonna work. </p><p>I was kinda bummed and set the project down for a few days. I was not sure it was even feasible any more. Between the cost of the chain, the pins, and injection molding the project was turning out to be way too expensive. I had even emailed about 10 chain suppliers and 8 of them said they could not supply the chain as parts. The remaining two gave me a quote that was 10 times more expensive than the assembled chain. At this point it looked like I was gonna have to build a robot to break the chain and based on breaking it by hand that was gonna be a bit of work. </p><p>I thought the project was dead. I could build a set for myself if I wanted, but it would never be a viable product. I just was so surprised by some of the quotes. When I was thinking about the design the injection molding seemed like the highest cost item. The pins and chain should be dirt cheap, but everything I was finding was the opposite of that.</p><p>I talked with a friend and he mentioned that I should check out Alibaba. I had seen the site before but always kinda ignored it because the shipping form china was way too high and you would need to order very large quantities to make it happen. But I decided to take a look and get some quotes. I was blown away with the responsiveness and the prices. I got responses from the companies in less than 24 hours asking for more details and production prints. In less than two days I had quotes that put the project back on track. At this stage I was mostly focusing on budgetary quotes. So I used the best guess for dimensions and didn't add any tighter tolerances. I just wanted to know is it even possible to make this. I found a potential supplier in China for the pins and the unassembled chian. </p><p>I then took another look at my design and realized that while snap rings were a good idea, I was reinventing the wheel a little bit. Roller chain already has something like this. It is called a master link and used to connect the chain. </p><p><img src="http://www.rollerchain4less.com/assets/images/connectinglink1.jpg">I realized that if I designed my pins to match those of the master link clips I could use those instead. Now the assembly is familiar to people who have worked with chain, does not require a special tool, and uses another off the shelf part. I also did a little work modeling up a special inner plate that would add horns to the tread for the bogie wheels. The horn is still a work in progress. Below are some pictures that show the new design.<br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8036691433350573259.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3362971433350582695.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6590211433350590085.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9589181433350600474.JPG"></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18888"><p>The design has come to the point where 3d printing treads was no longer practical. For starters I have been printing parts out of ABS plastic, which is quite a bit different from the production material. I plan for the treads to be made from a rigid rubber material similar to what car tires are made from. These will be over molded around a threaded stud. The threaded stud will add support. Additionally it is going to take quite a few treads to make a usable section of track. 3d printing these is just too slow.<br></p><p>I decided to give a shot at resin casting. I ordered some 2 part silicone and 2 part polyurathne rubber from <a href="http://Smooth-On.com" target="_blank">http://Smooth-On.com</a>. Then I used the 3d printer to print some positives. I 3d printed a few versions of the part. I wanted my mold to have two cavities. I printed two top halves of my tread connected by a support. I used this to cast the half of my mold. Once cured I removed the halve part, and replaced it with a full tread. I coated the first half of the mold with mold release and cast the second half.</p><p>After it was all said and done I had a silicone mold that I could put 4 threaded rods into and cast two tread parts. Having never worked with silicone molds or resin casting, it was a learning experience. I am sure that the next time I make molds they will come out much better. But they worked and will let me continue prototyping my design.</p><p>This is the resin I used:<img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1970181433347988144.JPG" style="width: 245px; height: 325.906976744186px;"></p><p>I weighed the parts and mixed them in a plastic cup.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2942931433348052782.JPG"></p><p>Then I put the cup into a DIY vacuum degassing chamber that I had. It is nothing too fancy, but it does the trick.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4937291433348097529.JPG"></p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1028261433348107942.JPG"><p>Next I filled up a syringe with the resin trying to be careful not to add any air bubbles. It might work better to transfer it to the syringe before degassing, but it would spill over the syringe during the process, holding the syringe upright was a pain, and without the plunger the resin will flow out the tip and make a mess. So I didn't worry about it. I filled the bottom half of the mold while it was open. It was much faster and easier than filling the whole mold through the sprue hole.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2480661433348239460.JPG"></p><p>Then I carefully put the top half of the mold on and used a rubber band to hold it together. The mold has keys built into to help with alignment. I set a couple pieces of steel bar on top to hold it down even more. When I made the mold I was not sure if I needed one or two sprues. So I tried both. This is my first time working with silicone molds and I wanted to learn as much as I could. I did find that the two sprue method worked slightly better and was less prone to having large voids in the part. But you have twice as many sprues to cut away. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2934171433348290200.JPG"></p><p>I learned that you have to fill the mold very slowly because the resin is thick and will build up enough pressure to separate the mold. When you fill the bottom half of the mold while it is open you can fill it much faster, and that is the actual tread profile. Many of the first parts I made had voids on the top half of the mold, but since this is not a functional surface it didn't cause a problem for testing.</p><p>Here is what the finished mold looks like.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3757601433348772944.JPG"></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-19031"><p>Well after a lot of emails with suppliers I finally found one that would sell me roller chain unassembled. I was surprised that most places just said no. But finally I found a few manufacturers that were interested and after several emails back and forth I got a quote and placed an order. </p><p>The shipping cost sucked in small quantities and getting it fast. If you send it by boat is much cheaper but takes forever. For production stuff this would be fine because I could order in bulk. But I had to use DHL and it cost over a hundred dollars for the shipping alone. But I got 250 feet of ANSI 35 roller chain parts. And I was able to get samples of the stainless steel version, and both mild steel and stainless for ANSI 40 roller chain. I ordered the roller chain first because I wanted to check the size of the pin holes. <a data-mention-project-id="353" href="/project/353"></a></p><p>I did some digging and while roller chain is defined by ANSI I could not find any hard rules for the pin hole diameter. Pins can be pressed, rivoted or even welded. The chain is defined in ANSI standard B29.1-2011 - Precision Power Transmission Roller Chains, Attachments, and Sprockets. You can buy a copy for $35 but I figured it would not tell me what I wanted to know anyway. Here is a link if anyone wants to buy me a copy.</p><p><a href="https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/b291-2011-precision-power-transmission-roller">ANSI B29.1</a><br></p><p>Best solution was to order some chain and check the pin hole sizes myself with a pin gauge set. I am quite lucky that my work has one of these and I could use it. So after about 20 emails in broken English I was able to work out the quote and place my order. About two weeks later my roller chain arrived. The packaging was pretty beat up and the plastic bags were falling apart so I used some old McMaster bags I had. I love McMaster. Even the shipping bags from McMaster are amazing. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7441611433456423095.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6570461433456438366.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7356921433456451972.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9516851433456462102.JPG"></p>Now that I had the parts I was able to use the pin gauge set to figure out the size of the holes in the inner and outer links, as well as the master clips. Below is a picture of the gauge set.<p><img src="http://www.micro-machine-shop.com/pin_gage_set_.061-.250_minus.jpg"><span></span><br></p></div>

I use calipers to get the thickness of the master clips, and pin gauges to measure the holes. Then I went back to my pin design and updated the dimensions to match. I took several samples of each part to look for variation in manufacturing. It was also time to add some tolerances to my print. </p><p>I went back and forth with the supplier in China about the pins. I needed to balance the production costs with the prototyping costs. I want the production pins to be as inexpensive as possible, but I also want to be able to order a small quantity up front to test. If I could commit to high quantities now they would send me samples, but I don't have that kind of money to invest up front. I wanted the prototypes to be the same parts I would use for production so I won't have to order another round of samples. </p><p>Another issue was I wanted to make pins that would work for both the mild steel chain as well as stainless steel. The dimensions were slightly different and that made it a little tricky to balance.</p><p>After several emails back and forth I was able to come up with a design that was cost effective, and that I could stomach the prototyping cost.

                                <div id="post-body-20678"><p>It has been a little while since my last post. I have been busy working on casting enough treads to build a working robot. </p><p>First I 3d printed some new mold masters. I decided to make a mold that would cast 5 parts at a time. My last mold could do two parts at a time and I could get between 4 and 6 parts a day. I needed something I could start mass producing these things. I created my model of the mold master and 3d printed a half version and a full version.</p><p>Half Version</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2595111436395311433.JPG"></p><p>Full Version</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5054311436395327315.JPG"></p><p>Next I laser cut a new mold box from acrylic. Since this part is bigger I could not use my previous one. These mold boxes work really well, are reusable, and pack away nice and tidy.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/410411436395394081.JPG"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4614511436395401930.JPG"></p><p>They fit tightly and the silicone does not leak out. There are holes for screws to hold it together, but I just used some tape and that was enough. Clamps would work well too. The best part is how easy you can take the box apart to remove your silicone mold.</p><p>I super glued my half master mold to the bottom and put in a few acorn nuts to create keys. Then I mixed up the silicone and poured it over the mold. This mold box just barely fits into my vacuum degassing chamber, so there was no need to worry about air bubbles.</p><p>LESSON LEARNED:</p><p>Make sure you look at the pot time on your silicone. Mine only had 6 minutes and I was not paying attention. I took my time and it started to set up while I was degaussing it. The mold came out a little rough on the backside, but totally usable.</p><p>Also, while I did not have trouble removing my ABS master, or the acrylic box. I should have coated it all with mold release first.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3891721436395707753.JPG"></p><p>Next I put the full master mold in first half of the mold and repeated the process. I worked much faster this time and added a red dye to the silicone to experiment with it. I sprayed the mold release after everything was assembled in the box. So you can see how the corners did not get coated. :( This caused the silicone to bond and I had to cut it apart. In the end it will not affect the performance of the mold. But something to keep in mind next time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4479831436395853884.JPG">All in all I am happy with the mold so far. It is only the second mold I have ever made and much larger than the previous one. I think it will get the job done. My previous mold had some air bubbles near the part that show up on the final cast parts. I think this one will be better. But you can see the layers of my 3d printed mold master. I could have vapor polished the part if I really cared, but I don't think it will matter for what I want to do.</p><p>Here is the mold together.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3547581436395914520.JPG">The 3d printer is making the mold inserts now to align the pins. Once that is done I will cast the first parts. </p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-20793"><p>Now that I have the custom pins, roller chain parts, and a new mold it was time to start producing some Tank Chain. I mixed up my Polyurethane Rubber and added a black pigment. Next I poured this into a plastic syringe and placed that into my vacuum degassing chamber. While it was degassing, I installed 10 of my custom pins into the mold inserts and installed it into the bottom half of my mold.</p><p>I degassed it for about 3 minutes being careful not to let it overflow while the bubbles popped. Then I removed it from the chamber and carefully installed the plunger. At this point I had a syringe full of liquid rubber ready to be injected into my mold. </p><p>I left the mold open and filled each pocket of the bottom half of the mold. There is no reason to try and fill the whole thing through the injection hole. This lets me make sure the top of my tread is full before closing the mold. It also fills much faster because there is no pressure.</p><p>Then I installed the top half of the mold and used rubber bands to hold the mold together. I used the syringe to inject the rubber through one of the two sprue holes. I applied a little pressure. The key is to have only a little positive pressure and be patient. If you inject the rubber too fast it won't flow evenly and will spread your mold apart. I learned that on my previous mold. I watched for the rubber to start to come out of the second sprue hole. Once it did, I removed my syringe and moved onto the next part. You have to work quickly but I didn't feel rushed. The 30 minute pot life was just about right for this project.</p><p>I wanted to document a few notes about cleaning up. DON'T DO IT. What I mean by that is don't try to clean any of the resin up while it is wet. Just let the stuff dry and peel it off. The resin in my cup and syringe pop out as one solid chunk if i let it harden. Not only can I reuse them, I can check if the resin is cured enough to demold my parts. </p><hr><p>The empty bottom half of the mold with the custom pins.</p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5919421436571002009.jpg"><p>Here is a picture of the mold after I filled it</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4808151436560050625.JPG"></p><p>Here is a picture of my mixing cup, mixing stick and syringe</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5162341436559911943.JPG"></p><p>Open Mold after the parts cured for 4 hours</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4502911436571133464.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3196171436571151466.jpg"></p><p>Removing the parts from the mold.

                                <div id="post-body-20794"><p>I got a really great comment about my design by Exuvo. I wanted to reply but could not put any pictures in the comments. So I decided to make a project log about it. </p><p>Exuvo pointed out that in his attempts to make continuous track he had problems with material getting into the chain and not being about to be pushed out. Full scale tanks don't have this problem because the drive mechanism is open on both ends and the sprocket just pushed material out of the way.</p><p>When I actually thought about this when I was coming up with the design. As far as I could see there were two options. <br></p><p>Option 1:</p><p>Leave the chain open and as you drive over material it could get stuck in the chain. But this allows the sprocket to push it back out. But I was worried that this would increase the risk of the chain jumping off the sprocket. </p><p>Option 2:</p><p>Cover the chain on the drive side. This prevents material getting into the chain from the ground. But it could still get in from the sides. I felt that this was more likely to reduce the amount of material getting into the chain.</p><p>It was not so much an oversight as a design choice. I decided that covering the chain was a better starting point. The other part of this is that the track is rubber and not connected on the outside of the chain. This means that the sprocket can actually push material through the chain and the rubber tread will deform to let it out. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/406851436560635341.JPG"></p><p>This is actually some of my older prototypes that have threaded rods and nylock nuts holding it together. But you can see that the track can flex out of the way. I am hoping this is enough to keep material out of the chain when you drive over it, but if something does get in the chain that the sprocket can push it out.</p><p>My plan is to build this design of the track, and get a working robot to drive around to test it out. I will do some experiments and see what works and what does not. I can always cut the rubber off my tracks and see if that works. I also have an idea about leaving the outside plate off my design and making it closer to the design on actual tanks.</p></div>
