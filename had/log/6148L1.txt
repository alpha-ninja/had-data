I haven't included some parts/prices I'm still awaiting quotes for. I'd like to take care of the fittings in person. The microcontroller EDEN will use is still under debate. I have about a dozen things I'm going to need to control. I have a Tiva C Series TI launchpad I'm considering, but am open to suggestions. </p><p>I am beginning to order some of the parts which will take a while to ship to US. Once I have the electronics and sensors I will find an adequate power supply. As I test parts and find them to be satisfactory I will be adding them to the supplies list on the project page.</p><p>If sparkfun can restock their pH kits I will be ordering one, but wont arrive until next month. For LED drivers I'd like to try to get some kind of help from one of the sponsors, as that will determine how crazy I can get with it. I may have a 3D model in the works soon. <br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-19227"><p>For tonights log I'd like to discuss some of the basic progress.</p><p>I have been thinking about the reservoir. There's a main tank where the nutrient is added. The nutrients being fed to the plant can vary way too much to automate it, so I'm leaving it upon the operator to decide their nutrient mixes and ratios (relatively easy). What EDEN can do is balance that nutrient mix to a determined pH level. The tank consists of the pH sensors that the controller reads to power perastaltic pumps which raise and lower the pH. There is also a high torque motor attached to a propeller which agitates the solution periodically, and a liquid level sensor. </p><p>The resevoir is the vessel that a solenoid opens to fill once the desired pH level is met in the tank. I want the resevoir to be smaller because the temperature of the solution will be easier to control. After alot of consideration I needed a vessel that's flat. I need an inlet for the solenoid from the tank, and an outlet for the solenoid to the high pressure pump. Flat surfaces make it easy to diy, but they also make for good placement of thermoelectric modules to control the temperature.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BMwAITQ.jpg" style="width: 323px; height: 285.241px;">So far these 32 oz tin plated steel jugs seem to be a good fit. There will be a temperature sensor inside and hopefully they should be easy to insulate and cool / warm.</p><p>I am a bit skeptical of the temperature range the TEC modules can achieve, but I must test them first. </p><p>EDEN needs to control the relative humidity and temperature in the vegetation area. Since I haven't gone over this yet, basically EDEN is 3 cylinders. The bottom cylinder is the guts with the tanks and controller. The middle cylinder is the grow area which is two parts, the root chamber and the vegetation area. The root chamber is a reflective, insulated, 8" tube where the roots are misted frequently. The vegetation area is where the leaves of the plant grow in the light and co2. Controlling temperature/humidity in this area is import to prevent mold or drying. Humidity up is simple for the most part, adjust the misting cycle to allow for controlled amounts to escape. Humidity down is harder - it requires a condenser for water molecules to gather on. I am considering using an 80mm radiator hooked up to TEC module which cools liquid.</p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zznJdoi.jpg" style="width: 340px; height: 312.225px;"><p>Its going to take testing, and these should be among the first of the parts arriving. I have pretty much finished the parts list and sorted it into priority by which parts take the longest.</p><p>The last cylinder is the LED array, thats a different story for a different day - but I have found a nice selection of collimator lens to reflect the LED light into a narrower feild. I'd love any tips about wholesalers - dx has them cheap but theyre the only ones. As always ideas and input are welome.</p></div>

I somehow ended up with them in my feed and found out about this today on my lunch break. </p> <iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mVwCoJtROhc" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe><p>It just so happens to be that within days of entering  Project EDEN into the hackaday prize, I found element14 hosting a design challenge focusing on vertical farming. The video is almost like reading the project description for Project EDEN.</p><p>What's even cooler is that the challenge supplies some much needed components to its participants. I have entered into this challenge needless to say. I also noticed a few of my followers are also doing farming related projects, so I hope to see a few of you enter.  The challenge has a few portable solar panels up for grabs to the winner, among other goodies - seems worth checking  out!</p><p>Getting some sponsorships could definitely help!<br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-19591"><p>This week I will be working on some of the web interface for EDEN. I have begun to order the components which are coming from China. I  want to work on as much code as possible in the meantime, so over the coming days I will be working on most of the front end. I will likely host a web server on EDEN which is connected to locally, but I'm toying with the idea of remote access. I'm also considering that protected WiFi networks will require passwords, so more thought must go into that whole situation. For now I just want the webpage built.</p><p>The interface will include features such as:</p><ul><li>Misting Interval / Amount + schedules</li><li>LED balance + schedules</li><li>pH balance + schedules</li><li>CO2 level + schedules</li><li>Relative Humidity + schedules</li><li>Temperature + schedules</li><li>Import / Export configuration</li></ul><p>That is the basic functionality I'd like to accomplish. Adafruit has some neat IR cameras that monitor plant growth which would be fun to implement into the web UI for comparing results, but that's for later. Later there will also be a need for a community webpage in which configurations could be exchanged, and of course a main website.</p><p>Aside from that, I've freed up more time and resources to see this project through to the end. I'd estimate by this time next month I should have all of the components short of the enclosure. <br></p></div>

The nutrient delivery system is mostly complete in terms of the design however I have been   struggling to make sure all the fittings are uniform to avoid unnecessary pressure fluctuation in the lines.</p><ul><li>CO2 SYSTEM</li></ul><p>The Carbon-Dioxide enrichment system not only keeps the plants inside of EDEN alive, it bulks them up allowing more growth to occur. Without a fresh supply of CO2 the plants will eventually wither away like my girlfriend's failed attempt to grow flowers in her window. The most basic way of supplying CO2 is by having good ventilation so outdoor air can circulate and replenish the CO2 concentration. This is easy to implement - however is less effective. Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels are not ideal for plant growth, even with all the fuss about climate change. There is also the challenge of keeping the air temperature just right, the humidity right, the pressure right, and the nasty pollutants out. Because of that, relying on ventilation varies too much to achieve controlled results like other alternatives offer.</p><p>EDEN will use 24 oz CO2 tanks. The tanks I have selected for this project are actually paintball tanks in order to allow ease of refills. Theoretically I expect the tanks to last the duration of the grow, if they run out - they can be refilled during the sleep cycles since plants use light to absorb CO2. I have invested a good amount of confidence in these tanks after seeing them used in aquaponics projects, with some users actually complaining that their aquarium plants are getting too big. </p><p>CO2 tanks for paintball guns typically are around 800-1000 psi, overpowering most of the electronically controlled gas solenoids I've found for the project. I've found a low pressure regulator which will drop the pressure down to around 100 psi, however I must do extensive testing to make sure it's not going to vent CO2 outside of the gas lines. It has been a challenge to ensure all fittings match up perfectly, but progress is being made.</p><p>I'm going with a cheaper CO2 sensor like the MG-811 and coupling it with a pressure sensor to determine the right flow intervals. Something to note is that a full tank releasing gas for 5 seconds is going to be quite different from a low tank releasing gas for 5 seconds because of a pressure drop. The pressure sensor will detect drops which helps to calculate how long to keep the solenoid open and when the tank is low. The role of the CO2 sensor is to determine the overall demand. </p><ul><li>LED Array</li></ul><p>The LEDs are closely tied to the CO2 System. From my research I have come to the conclusion that the CO2 absorption rates increase as the amount of light increases. Initially when I learned of CO2 enrichment I became skeptical of greenhouse gases because plants thrive at higher levels, until I realized that the amount of light would not increase to accommodate those absorptions. The LED array must be powerful enough to provoke higher CO2 consumption. </p><p>Many hydroponics projects use crazy expensive lights, with claims of 'full spectrum' and gigantic power consumption being used as marketing standards. LEDs are not only more power efficient, they allow for targeting the spectrum of light that chlorophyll captures and uses for photosynthesis. Our optical sense tells us these huge HID arrays are bright, but plants have a different sense of optics.  <br></p><p>This week I found an LED supplier in China that is selling 3W LEDs with pcbs for around $35 per hundred. I'm anxiously trying to order these ASAP so they arrive before THP deadlines. They are 440-470nm (Blue/Royal Blue) and 610-660nm (Red/Deep Red), and emit about 70 lumens of brightness each. I expect to use around 300-400 LEDs. 900-1200 watts of light is quite a bit, but my logic behind that amount is due to the idea that not all of those LEDs will be active at once. They can be, but I intend to separate the LEDs into stands of 12. These strands will be regulated by a converter with a switch that can customize the spectrum the plants receive. The light that is optimal for early stages of growth differs from the light that is optimal in later phases. I want to allow custom LED profiles, but I intend to do a few presets - like power saver, phase based, maximum growth, maximum brightness. </p><ul><li>Power</li></ul><p>Driving all of those LEDs, sensors, solenoids, and other electronics is going to take a pretty decent power supply. I calculate a demand for around 1500 watts maximum, and for now I've decided to go with a decent desktop PC power supply. </p><p> I will use my TI MSP430 for the LED controller, and an Arduino Due for just about everything else. I am going to spend most of this next week bouncing between web design and double checking that the fittings for everything are compatible. Next weekend I will be doing more work in the realm of circuit design. Here's a glimpse at the nutrient system. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9943971435353570847.jpg"></p></div>

In the below diagram you can see numbers which indicate a particular bulkhead union or fitting. I have also calculated the hose diameters and its looking like I'm I'll be making a large part order in the near future. Prior to ordering all of my components I will be updating the components list and attaching a spreadsheet with numbered parts and an assembly diagram.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ga8G6G4.jpg"></p><p>The LED array is at the height of my priorities because the deadlines and shipping ETA is becoming ever closer.</p><p>I have d<span>ecided that I will use 288 LEDs consisting of about 198 red (about half deep red) and 90 blue (about 40 royal blue). I will also use 6 high power white LEDs for observation. I will arrange these in a hexagonal matrix of about 7 rows. At approximately 3w each that provides around 900w of lighting at full brightness.</span></p><p>I ran into a problem with the original plan of using an 8 inch diameter pipe for the root chamber. 8 inch pipe runs about $40 per foot. I decided a more effective solution would be to make a hexagonal root chamber. Flat surfaces are easier to mount pipe entries onto for the plant base. I'm excited to implement this new strategy because formerly a circular pipe would have been a hastle for potatos, turnips, and carrots - as it would have left the roots mostly inaccessable. With a hexagonal root chamber they can be removed as panels allowing for easier harvesting. If possible Id like to use a transparent material so root growth can be examined by removing the reflective sheilding around it.</p><p>Apart from that it is mainly the temperature/humidity system that needs to be drafted. I have ideas but considering that I have about 6 weeks remaining I may put this aside until I have a beta unit completed.</p></div>

The white LEDs are mostly intended for monitoring plants with the human visible spectrum, but I'd like for them to be able to be utilized for their spectrum signature as well. I'll be prototyping with some old PC power supplies I've found laying around at work until I can sink more into a fancy ~1500w PSU.</p><p>In other news, it looks like GE and Phillips are onto the right idea!</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YJFZGJW.jpg"><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/philips-is-developing-led-light-growth-recipes-for-indoor-farms-08392246/">http://www.slashgear.com/philips-is-developing-led-light-growth-recipes-for-indoor-farms-08392246/</a><br></p><blockquote>The researcher center is 234m2 — one of the biggest ever, says Philips — and it is located in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

                                <div id="post-body-21164"><p>So last week my buddy Dakota and I talked more about the project. Dakota brought to my attention some issues going into drafting the project that needed further work. In this case it was mostly the root chamber and mounting it to the rest of the enclosure. Its now past 5am and  mostly figured out, have a look?</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z7dBgUt.png"></p><p>I wanted the root chamber to be modular and to support the weight of the LED array in addition to several pounds of vegetation. What I am left with is about 5 feet of root chamber with 15 growing pods (the circles - to be coupled with an elbow and rockwool growing base). There is a capability for much more than this, but I don&apos;t want any canopies.</p><p><img style="width: 536px; height: 186px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/JRwlJPS.png" height="186" width="536"></p><p>The windows between the pods will have removable magnetic PET plastic sheets to access the roots for harvesting, or to take a quick look at the root structure. The end result will be wrapped in a reflective barrier to prevent light from damaging the roots. I&apos;m pretty satisfied with this root chamber because it can be  easily be modified for more or less plants depending on their size. </p><p>More work must go into the structure of the enclosure. I must also address the heat the LED array is bound to produce, and there&apos;s a lot of power distribution stuff to think about. </p><p>I&apos;ll conclude this log with an updated partslist!<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lPFTdldgs6HVyugyByvTj9iVUbvBaWwO2ivABECh8HU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lPFTdldgs6HVyugyByvTj9iVUbvBaWwO2ivABECh8HU/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>It&apos;s just about finished, it has the correct pipe fittings and most of the equipment short of the temp/humidity stuff. I will add parts to the official components list as I build EDEN. </p><p>This week I am putting more thought into the programming as components will be coming in soon.<br></p></div>

They&apos;re brighter than I had expected and I&apos;m excited for the power components to get here so I can fire up all 300 of them. They&apos;re smaller than I anticipated which is good. I did the math and found out 100,000 lumens is possible with current array sizes, but that would take at least a 2kW psu and serious heat dissipation. </p><p>On the subject of heat, I revisited the temperature / humidity system and decided to do things differently. The temperature control would be awesome but we are talking about an additional ~500W of power and some pricey components to make a proper vapor compression heat pump. The power cant go any higher as the LED array already pushes 900W. Temperature control is also not really necessary indoors, and residential/commercial conditioning would be a lot more effective in cost and control.</p><p>Humidity control on the other hand is necessary. Mold can grow with high humidity and plants can dry out with low humidity. So I&apos;ve decided to take a peltier module, attach a copper water cooling block on each side, and run them through a pump to two radiators. The cold radiator will collect the moisture in the air and recycle it into the tank, the hot side will maintain the temperature from the cooling. A temperature sensor will still be used for analysis. </p><p>Project submissions have about 3 weeks remaining so I&apos;m in a rush to get the prototype going and all everything shipped. Today I visited the hardware store and began buying components for the enclosure. </p><p><img style="width: 345px; height: 262px;" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6646081437892727619.png" height="262" width="345"></p><p>This is what will be used for the bottom enclosure. I will be adding the supplies to an updated partslist after construction. Its basically going to resemble a hexagonal prism for a frame, with sheet metal bolted around it. The sheet metal will have a magnetic strip around the top for the airtight seal when the radiant barrier is wrapped around it. The reason EDEN is a circle is because that is going to be the simplest shape to prevent air leaks in seams.  A square would be easier in many regards, but it isn&apos;t easy to seal without restricting access to the plants, and corner space is wasted space. </p><p>My last update is that the webserver is progressing. I&apos;ve been using the Polymer development kit for a mobile friendly UI that scales to tablets and larger screens. Over the next week my goal is to complete the front end and get absolutely everything in the mail since all the chinese parts are on the way. Next week I will be programming whatever I can, and video documenting some of the build progress.<br></p></div>
