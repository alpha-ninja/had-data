Aquaculture systems require careful and precise control of a range of nutrients. Although, in these natural systems, the levels of these nutrients tend to vary across the day &#x2013; making manual techniques cumbersome and fraught with error. Research into detection systems failed to find any products meeting capable of reliable, automated measurement of a range of nutrients. Most available sensors only detect select compounds, which meant no alternatives existed outside expensive laboratory-grade equipment. Our strong background in science drove us to research other analytical techniques that could detect the presence of compounds. We uncovered a powerful technique called Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) which allowed for the repeatable detection of ions with different charges without the need for expensive, closed-source components. Unfortunately affordable (&lt;USD$10k) commercial implementations of CE are relatively non-existent which drove the development of the C&#x2074;Dapillary open-source CE platform. This project will focus on the detection of ions in water, given the vast potential for improving Humanity&apos;s quality of life, although the potential applications are innumerable.</p><p>Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) works by passing a high voltage current through a solution filling a micron-diameter glass capillary tube. The current passing across the charged ions causes them to migrate from one side of the tube to the other. This causes them to pass the detector at different times allowing them to be mapped onto a chart called an electrophoretogram. This technique was limited in its widespread application as it was often coupled with UV-based optical detectors which are prohibitive due to their expense. Conductivity based detectors offered a cheaper alternative but came into direct contact with the solution, degrading and bio-fouling over time causing spurious measurements. This project uses a detection system that negates the large costs of UV and other spectroscopy based CE implementations by using wireless detection of CE separated ions. This process is superior to Spectroscopy techniques as it removes interaction between ions, a large source of error in separated samples.</p><p>You can imagine this like dropping several different coins off the top of a tall enough building. If you stood on the ground you could determine each of them by the time when they hit the ground, with the lowest surface area to mass ratio first. The following GIF shows how the CE process works,</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VS1Yd31Rc57sC8WQfJhW5GSo0U4iQNkFVmg0x6bAjj6sY6VNeFaBD4cnyO0crY72UipCbw7aIpzmJgbH-aAkJl-eSXuCyGazOmov-qptmuncVS-kFPD5_1QiTQC9750okyjCd7w"></p><p>This illustrates the Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) technique using a detection system called Contactless Conductivity Capacitively Coupled Detection (C&#x2074;D). C&#x2074;D functions by applying a high-voltage electrical signal across the capillary and reading the signal as it is attenuated by the solution passing through the capillary. The attenuated signal is converted to a DC voltage signal with peaks as each ion passes through the sensor. As the different ions are separated through CE the time the ion passes the detector can be compared to a standard sample and the ion identified.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.unwater.org/wwd10/downloads/water_quality_human_health.pdf">Executive Director of the United Nations Environmental Programme states</a> that the lack of resources for monitoring and assessment make it difficult to obtain a global picture of water quality. The application of the CE-C&#x2074;D to the monitoring of compounds in drinking and sanitary water has the potential to address many of the issues in the resourcing of sustainable water management. The impact of widespread access to an affordable automated nutrient monitoring system is a paradigm shift from our current complicated and onerous measurement processes. Technology such as this in the hands of the average citizen empowers the population with knowledge of their water quality and, with simple cloud based technology, has potential to expand to a global community of water researchers.</p><p>From our research it is becoming increasing clear that the potential applications of CE-C&#x2074;D are almost limitless. While nutrient monitoring is critical to human health it is also an important indicator in the health of other natural systems that are critical to human survival. A large proportion of the world relies heavily on seafood as a source of food, while significant research suggest our Ocean&#x2019;s health is rapidly declining. A fleet of self-sustaining, marine drones equipped with our system could provide the consistent, repeatable and precisely timed measurement of nutrients required to effectively monitor and study the oceans health. The scientific confidence that such an intellectual resource could provide would inform intervention and prevention strategies for minimising harm to our oceans and ultimately the Earth.</p><p>We hope you see the same potential in our C&#x2074;Dapillary open CE-C&#x2074;D platform and upcoming water testing prototype. We&apos;re excited to be working on something that may just change the world and we look forward to hearing your thoughts as we progress.</p></div>

This measure contains highly valuable information on the contents of a solution as its conductivity is proportional to the sum of the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_dissolved_solids">wiki</a>]. Measurement of TDS is typically used as an aggregate indicator of chemical contaminants in the study of water quality, particularly relating to agricultural runoff and industrial pollution. Our system utilises this principle in combination with a separation technique to detect specific substances within the TDS. We apply a technique called<a href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Analytical_Chemistry/Instrumental_Analysis/Capillary_Electrophoresis"> Capillary Electrophoresis</a> (CE) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis">wiki</a>] which separates the solution into a series of ionic bands that migrate past a stationary detector at varying times, allowing for individual substances to be identified and quantified.</p><p>Conductivity detection has been employed in CE and chromatography for some time however the initial iterations employed a contact-based approach, typically a fixed eC/TDS probe, which came into direct contact with the solution. While this technique is highly sensitive the electrode is subject to degradation, this causes measurement drift due to heterogeneous oxidation of the electrode surface which diminishes the machine&#x2019;s precision and operational lifespan.The full potential of the technology was realised with the introduction of contactless detection systems, which led to the development of the technology we have chosen: Capacitively-Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detection (C&#x2074;D). C&#x2074;D utilises the wall of the capillary as a dielectric to wirelessly transmit an electrical signal through the solution which is attenuated by the change in resistance due to the ion concentration. </p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WbvANaUCMbtx-jjTEZvdnZWu-EchOqApUzgWBbpDNR7MMWj2r8r_sfXPeo_iCQ8J-oTSeVEbFAL7_30STWjzJwQy9mhWd6Em2PYrTEDYp1H0wZMFCJGkbfMjHDw9QkDgIQbk6g"></p><p>The C&#x2074;D technique allows for a much simpler transmission and receipt of the excitation signal over typical light (UV) and contact-based (TDS) detection, without expensive image sensors and complex capillary windows. The versatility of using C&#x2074;D with the CE separated samples means that by manipulating only a few simple parameters of the system almost any substance can be identified and measured. This replicates the function of most Ion Specific Electrodes (ISEs) by utilising a separation technique to get the desired solute by itself, in place of specific electrodes for each solute. The relative simplicity of this technique makes it a highly versatile yet low-cost way to detect the presence of substances in a sample that is highly suited to automated sampling and reporting of water quality.</p><p>The measurement of electrolytic conductivity is achieved by measuring the resistance of the solution. Measuring the resistance involves passing an electrical signal through the solution and measuring the attenuation of the signal as different ions pass the electrodes. Contactless detection in a Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) systems couples electrodes to the capillary forming a picofarad capacitor, which requires a high frequency input signal to transmit current through the solution. As ions pass through the electrode the change in resistance of the solution R causes a change in the resultant current I=V/R. The current of the output signal is converted to a voltage by a transimpedance op-amp (current-voltage conversion) which is then synchronously demodulated into a DC voltage, cleaned of noise and sampled by an onboard ADC. The flowchart below describes the components and operation of our detection circuit.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AIPE7aMRLDk7YRIrtqxTE8_bDaED24ybagtiVY0BpnuHpGariTPzZkeQ-9X4YdT-gtxTjZSKOLTZuxImimWhqNhFY6u_W-l3Xys06Ut0AXwlS1V0SaJkXePbrKtSfQPl-rNHYXc" width="895" height="716" style="width: 895px; height: 716px;"></p><p>The transmission signal is a vital component of our detection circuitry as the working parameters of the system allow calibration of the platform for optimal detection sensitivity (Signal-Noise Ratio - SNR). The signal is generated by the AD9833 function generator which produces a 0.6Vp-psignal that can amplified up to 20Vp-p with a high speed op-amp. Combining this with a N87 transformer with a primary coil of 10 windings and secondaries with 100 and 110 windings gives a final working excitation voltage range of 1-200V which will be functional between 50kHz and 1.5MHz. This is slightly higher than the minimum working frequency of the system, which is in the order of 10&#x2019;s of kHz due to the small coupling capacitance of the capillary-electrode configuration.  The upper limit must be within component specifications but detection is mainly limited when stray capacitance across the electrodes distorts the signal as the resistance of the air is negated by the transmission frequency. </p><p>The excitation signal is separated into 2 phase-shifted signals by the transformer which are each passed through different electrodes positioned at separate ends of the capillary. The electrodes are positioned such that the sample solution is only passing through one electrode at any one time, with the other electrode measuring the conductivity of the background electrolyte. These 180&#xB0; out of phase signals are combined after detection such that <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-3/Interference-of-Waves">phase cancellation</a> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)">wiki</a>] cancels the signal from the conductivity of the background electrolyte, leaving only the signal created by the band passing the detector. This C&#x2074;D configuration is typically referred to as a referenced system, and serves to greatly enhance the detection limit of the C&#x2074;D detector. </p><p>The phase-cancelled signal is then amplified by the pickup amplifier and passed to an AD630 synchronous demodulator, also known as a lock-in amplifier. Synchronous demodulation functions somewhat similarly to rectifying a band passed signal, where the amplitude of only a narrow spectrum of the signal is measured. Synchronous demodulation overcomes the difficulty of high precision filters by using the unamplified signal from the function generator as a reference and only demodulating the component of the attenuated signal in-phase with the transmission signal. The demodulated signal is then stripped of any lingering AC signal using a low pass filter and sent to a PGA281 to adjust the gain to within the parameters of a 24 bit 14ksps TI ADS1259 Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). </p><p>The prototype design of our platform may be perceived as somewhat excessive in its componentry. This was our intention for the development of the prototype as many of the operational parameters are not rigorously defined, even in academic research. Our design is primarily an experimental so we have used high precision components to allow complete control of the parameters in order to experimentally identify the optimal parameters for future applications. As an example our platform uses the ADS1259, with a 24-bit resolution and up to 14k samples per second, which will generate an excessive amount of data (our mathematician insisted). Yet our water testing prototype may only need an ADC that can do 20sps at a lower bit-rate. We also have a few high speed op-amps to evaluate in order to see which one gives the best frequency response for our system. As we progress into the testing phase of our system we will provide more detailed updates on these parameters and components.</p></div>

This technique is commonly implemented in applications that only require knowledge of the total dissolved solids [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_dissolved_solids">wiki</a>] (referred to as TDS or &#x2018;ppm&#x2019;) in a solution, such as in hydroponics, where a user is primarily concerned with aggregate nutrient thresholds for plant growth. When testing the quality of a water supply, we are interested in the levels of particular pollutants that are harmful at small levels, like arsenic. The maximum safe level of arsenic in a water supply is considered to be <a href="http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/arsenic.cfm#What%20are%20EPA%27s%20drinking%20water%20regulations%20for%20arsenic?">~10 &#x3BC;g/L</a>. The traditional TDS-based approach can barely detect a noticeable change in total ion concentration at these levels, let alone single-out arsenic from the jumble of dissolved ions &#x2013; making TDS measurements functionally useless for most environmental monitoring applications.</p><p>Effective detection of specific analytes (arsenic, mercury, pesticides, etc) is best achieved through separation of the sample into its chemical constituents, allowing them to be identified and quantified individually by a single system (the C&#x2074;D detector). </p><p><strong>Separation techniques</strong> </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process#List_of_separation_techniques">Separation techniques</a> are not new and usually rely upon variations in a physical property among the ions of a solution. The separation procedure employed in this build is capillary electrophoresis (CE) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis">wiki</a>]. CE sorts chemicals by differences in <a href="http://apps.who.int/phint/en/p/docf/">electrophoretic mobility</a>, a property unique to each molecule. This is accomplished by drawing the sample into a very thin (10-100&#x3BC;m) ID <a href="http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-capillary-tube.htm">capillary tube</a> and subjecting it to high voltage (2-30kV) DC. The capillary serves to create an environment with a high surface area/volume ratio, allowing more interactions that facilitate the separation to take place. Separation occurs to a point where ions migrate in independent &#x2018;bands&#x2019; sequentially past a stationary detector, enabling them to be identified and measured.</p><p> <img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7509371439709735800.png" style="width: 526px; height: 311px;" width="526" height="311"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span></p><p>Adopted from: <a href="http://theses.ulaval.ca/archimede/fichiers/24330/apa.html">http://theses.ulaval.ca/archimede/fichiers/24330/apa.html</a></p><p><br>The above image represents the expected migration order of ions inside a capillary when it is exposed to an electric field. Note that small, highly charged ions migrate to the electrodes at a higher rate than larger ions with less charge. Anions migrate toward the anode, while cations migrate towards the cathode.<br></p><p>The signal intensity of the C&#x2074;D detector enclosing the capillary tube can be charted over time to identify and measure the concentrations of individual ions with high repeatability and precision. This can be represented on a graph as an electropherogram. Each peak represents an analyte passing the detector and its magnitude is proportional to the concentration of each substance. Peaks are assigned to a particular analyte by comparing readings to a separation conducted on a standard solution of known constitution. An example electropherogram is shown below:</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eGoqveAlFDQeRmpYkKDb2KFQNRA96-Bqnufo_UODnBlyJq940t5CLPW6UpTJMcERGtKOyhbj8PIsEBJWOdrNBdrkSb57nJ4qFwd3X7AI9IX9One9Ek_4ppJns-30BmJvMIbGCoY"></p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.dionex.com/en-us/webdocs/4234-an91.pdf">http://www.dionex.com/en-us/webdocs/4234-an91.pdf</a></p><p>So what is actually making this happen in there? As with standard spherical particles, the velocity of charged ions moving in an electric field is the proportional to of the electrokinetic energy introduced to the particleFEK by the electric field <strong>E</strong> and the particle&#x2019;s drag <strong>Fd</strong> in a viscous solution (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">Stoke&#x2019;s law</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>In the case of capillary electrophoresis, an ion&#x2019;s total electrophoretic velocity <strong>v</strong> is described by the following relationship:</p><p><img src="/api/latex?tex=%5Ccolor%7BWhite%7D%20%5Clarge%20v%20%20%5Cpropto%20%20%5Cfrac%7BF_%7BEK%7D%7D%7BF_%7Bd%7D%20%7D%5Cnewline%0Awhere%0A%5Cnewline%5Cindent%20%0AF_%7BEK%7D%20%3D%20qE%20%5Cnewline%5Cindent%0AF_%7Bd%7D%20%3D%206%20%5Cpi%20%5Ceta%20R"></p><p>Where:<br></p><p>q is the charge of the ion.</p><p>&#x3B7; is the viscosity of the solvent (usually water).</p><p>R is the radius of the ion.</p><p>As these physical attributes are unique to each ion, we can expect that some charged particles will migrate through the electric field quicker than others. Because of this, the particles will pass the stationary detector, positioned at a fixed distance, at varying times. You could think of this like drawing a line of a piece of paper and using it to separate ink. Each dye in the ink moves up the paper at different rates due to inherent differences in the strength of interaction with the charged paper surface. In our case, the &#x2018;paper&#x2019; is a capillary tube in an electric field and the &#x2018;line&#x2019; is the stationary C&#x2074;D detector. The picture below shows the banding produced by applying an electric field to food dye dissolved in water. We can see that this method provides a robust separation of the components of the dye, which are observed as distinct coloured bands.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vfQAHLIluqLGjymLztiVQDWEfjERKczAbsCiZLlglKdGSZ9WLc05W2bwvm_TlFAd-xwirZNFfFsA1Y9C0oKMj4TkYcOzLkeBrXZwQuA4T_8v3v3C24UrDsPX8AC1mjR-wLOJ4uw" width="372" height="494" style="width: 372px; height: 494px;"> </p>Source: <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio:Notebook/Keiki_Gels">http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio:Notebook/Keiki_Gels</a></div>

Bands of ions are detected as they cross a wireless conductivity detector at different times.</p><p>In order to minimise interference due to stray capacitance and impurities, a background electrolyte (BGE) is usually included in the separation buffer. BGEs are usually weakly conductive and serve to provide a stable reference signal for the detector. An ideal BGE is an ampholyte [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphoterism">wiki</a>] &#x2013; a molecule that can contain negative and positive charges, depending on the pH. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine">Histidine</a> is commonly used as a BGE in capillary electrophoresis as it exists as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion">zwitterion</a> (a form having equal positive and negative charges) at the pHs used in most electrophoresis protocols. This prevents it from being affected by the applied electric field, maintaining a uniform distribution of BGE throughout the capillaries over the run.<br></p><p>Histidine is a relatively safe chemical that can be purchased at low cost, making ideal as a BGE in our system. 250g can be purchased for USD $40, enough for thousands of runs.</p><p>Histidine can be purchased from here:</p>

The local build-up of these species creates zones of varying pH within the electrolyte. This phenomena significantly affects the reproducibility of readings in capillary electrophoresis and as such, a pH buffering agent [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution">wiki</a>] is usually included in the sample buffer. Buffers are able to resist the addition of acid or base and maintain the solution at a constant pH. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MES_(buffer)">MES</a> finds use in the majority of electrophoresis publications as a pH buffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good%27s_buffers">for a few reasons</a>. It is also readily available and inexpensive &#x2013; perfect for us! Using MES as the pH buffer will allow us to adjust the pH from around 5.15 to 7.15. </p><p>MES can be purchased from here:</p>

If the length of the capillary is not sufficient, these bands will not separate (resolve), giving a superimposed peak on the detector. It is impossible to identify and quantify analytes of interest if they are part of a superimposed peak, therefore chemical modifiers are sometimes introduced into a separation buffer. Modifiers bind to their targets, usually a particular class of chemical (monovalent cations, or divalent heavy metals, for example) and alter their electrophoretic mobility by affecting the molecule&#x2019;s mass/charge ratio and surface area. </p><p>A common example of using chemical modifiers in the literature is the separation of potassium (K&#x207A;) and ammonium (NH4&#x207A;) ions. These ions are both important water quality parameters but in the MES/His buffer system commonly employed, the peaks for these two ions co-migrate. By add. 18-crown-6 ether is added, which attaches to the ions, altering their electrophoretic mobilities and enabling resolution of the independent peaks. </p><p>More information about this process can be found at the following link:</p><p><a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/biology/warren/docs/ce_cations.pdf">http://sydney.edu.au/science/biology/warren/docs/ce_cations.pdf</a></p>

<p>As the MES/His system is in widespread use, we do not see any immediate circumstances that would require the use of alternative buffers, but when our platform is released to the community we will make these reagents available and easy to use should the need arise.
