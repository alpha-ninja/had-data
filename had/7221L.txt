                                <div id="post-body-22798"><p>Hacking the Wheelchair</p>      <p>Starting off</p>    <p>We are beginning a studio making wheelchair accessories. We started off this studio by learning Autodesk Fusion, the software we will be using for this project. Fusion is a 3D modeling software that allows you to edit dimensions and sizes on models you make. We spent the first few days making objects in the software as exercises. I made a phone case.</p>    <p>Once we were done learning the software, we brainstormed as a studio group on what improvements a wheelchair needs and how we can hack it. We want to accessorize the wheelchair as apposed to redesign it. We broke up into groups and started to brainstorm more in-depth.</p>    <p>Our group decided on making the wheelchair faster. We live in a busy fast paced world that the wheelchair hasn&#x2019;t necessarily kept up with. We want to use a ratchet mechanism, which would allow the user to wheel faster in the chair in a rowing motion as opposed to a wheeling motion, a similar motion to the arms on an elliptical machine. We are mainly focusing on the ratchet mechanism moving the wheelchair forward but hopefully if we have time we can work on brakes as well.</p>      <p>Attachments</p>    <p>We started off the day with a lot of bike parts. We wanted to get the parts from the bike wheels to see if we could use them for our project. We took the wheels apart and explored, and found that we already had some mechanisms from parts that we could recycle instead of creating our own. We started making attachments that would make the parts usable for our particular situation. The tricky thing is that because of the parts that we have, the wheels can only turn one way so we have to use a slightly different system for each wheelchair wheel. The left and right wheels are flipped mechanically. We spent the day designing separate parts for each. We should be able to test them out on Tuesday once they have all printed out. Fingers crossed that it will work!</p>      <p>More Parts</p>      <p>Today we continued the process of making parts and testing them out. We put the main part of the right side together today, and it&#x2019;s looking like it&#x2019;s going to work well. We are just waiting to finish the design and print one more part to finish it off. Hopefully it will work and we can start on the left wheel tomorrow.</p>  <p>We have put the breaks part of our project on hold, and are just focusing on the speed right now. We are chugging along!</p>        <p>Design Change</p>      <p>Throughout the studio we have kept the project pretty simple design change-wise. We have pretty much kept the same design the entire way through, but today we made a design change. </p>    <p>After testing our previous spider attachment design we realized that we needed to beef it up because it was breaking when we applied force on it. We also realized that the way we were connecting the 8020 bar to the mechanism wasn&#x2019;t helping our design. It was giving it too much torque, and adding stress to the entire mechanism. We took out the need for a right angle with the 8020 bars and redesigned the connector to accommodate the changes. We are printing out the final pieces tonight and tomorrow!</p>        <p>Whoops!</p>    <p>Today we had a realization. After we put one of the sides together we realized that we had made two of the same sides, but in different ways. We made two of the right side, although this was unplanned and would be considered a mistake, it turned out to be a good thing. We had come up with two completely different ways to do the same thing and through doing this we found that one way was much better. </p>    <p>Once we had wrapped our mind around making the left side of the system, it actually wasn&#x2019;t that difficult. We had all the hard parts made, and just had to edit them a little to be able to use them for the left side. They are printing out over the weekend, and hopefully they will fit right into place on Monday. We are cutting it close!</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-22799"><p>Phase Two</p>    <p>We are taking the hand drive to a new level for independent studies. We are completely redesigning it. We realized with our last model that we couldn&#x2019;t move backwards, and that was a problem.</p>    <p>We are now remaking the hand drive without the free wheel mechanism. The free wheel was what was preventing the wheelchair from going backwards. We are making our own ratchet mechanism, which is very similar to the free wheel, but it allows us to go backwards. Instead of having one ratchet like the free wheel, it has two ratchets each on a different plane. Depending which ratchet is engaged, it allows the wheelchair to go either forward or backwards. The two ratchets are connected by cables which allows the user to disengage one ratchet and engage the other through one swift and easy motion. Our first model is almost done! </p>      <p>How it Works</p>    <p>Once we made our wooden prototypes it was time to start making 3D models. We started the modeling process with a clean slate. We made a new spider attachment that will fit more snug to the wheel, so hopefully it won&#x2019;t pop off as easily. The gears for the ratchet are also on the spider attachment. We made the gears with a plate in between them so that the ratchets won&#x2019;t slip out of place. Through testing the gears, we learned we don&#x2019;t want the gear to curve as much, but want it to be more of a right angle. It really takes a minimal amount of distance for the gears to cover, for them to be functional. </p>    <p>The lever piece houses the ratchet and the cabling. The lever is on the outer side of the ratchet. The lever piece consists of a disk with holes placed for the ratchet pieces to fit into. It also has pulleys for the cables, and a hole through the center where it screws into the spider piece. The level isn&#x2019;t as complex of a piece compared to the spider, but it has to line up and fit perfectly with the spider, which is a frustrating little challenge for us to have.</p>        <p>Frustrating</p>    <p>Once we really started to chug along with our model, disaster struck. Fusion, the program we had been using for modeling, had decided it didn&#x2019;t like our model anymore and therefore it wouldn&#x2019;t work. We ended up having to remodel the entire project in different files. We lost a day and a half of work time in this process. </p>        <p>Progress</p>    <p>Once we remade the models in different files, and got the project back to the point it was before, we started moving forward again. One of our design challenges was figuring out the springs in the design. The springs push the ratchets into the gear, and are essential to the design. In our initial wooden prototypes we used coil springs. The unfortunate part about those springs is that they are too bulky. We want our project to be as slim and sleek as possible, so we started looking into other options. </p>    <p>We ended up creating a spring from a piece of steel. It is a thin strip of steel that wants to stay straight. We found that if we use it in our design a little bent, it will want to stay straight- thus acting as a spring to get straight. We modeled and printed a prototype with this design. We found that the steel spring was pretty hefty, and too much spring. We are going to see if we can get more flexible steel to tone it down a little bit. </p>    <p>Once we realized the steel spring was too hefty, we started to come up with an alternative. We made a design with the regular coil springs as a back up in case the steel doesn&#x2019;t work. I am personally routing for the steel springs, because it is a much more elegant design. </p>      <p>Cables</p>    <p>Once we had figured out the basic ratchet mechanism, we had to figure out how to make it work with cables. Only one of the ratchet pegs can be down at a time, and depending on which ratchet is down determines whether the user is wheeling forward or backwards. The cables are used to easily switch which ratchet is down, thus changing the direction of the wheelchair. </p>    <p>The tricky part is figuring out how to use one cable to cause one ratchet to go down and one ratchet to go up. We were originally thinking the ratchets would each want to go a separate way naturally, because of the springs. When the cable was pulled, it would push one ratchet down and pull the other up. This wasn&#x2019;t the most elegant solution, because the cables were getting tangled with the gear when the ratchets spun. </p>    <p>Our new solution is to have the ratchet pegs be different. One ratchet peg attaches to the top of the cable and another ratchet peg attaches to the bottom. This way when the cable is pulled, it pulls one down by its back, and one up by its toes. We haven&#x2019;t tested this solution yet, but it is looking good.</p>    <p>Bikes</p>    <p>Throughout the project, we are finding more and more similarities to a bike. All of the cabling for our project is bike cabling, and we are going to use a bike break for the handles. It is interesting to compare a wheelchair to a bike and see the similarities. </p></div>

We had to remodel our mechanism to take into account  the new springiness and angles of the springs. We found that it was faster to just 3D print the pieces extruded from the base rather than print the whole base again and again. We used laser cut wood to replace the base in our prototyping.</p>    <p>We also redesigned the spider attachment for the wheelchair. We made it so it uses less material but still has the same structural integrity.</p>    <p>Tape</p>    <p>We added double sided tape to our gear to soften the sound of the ratchet. The lighter spring makes the system a little quieter, but the double tape seals the deal.</p>    <p>We are still chugging right along, and making progress. We are closing in on the details.

We started working on the individual pieces of the ratchet as opposed to the entire ratchet mechanism.</p>    <p>We were having a hard time getting the springs to work on the ratchets, and having them do what we wanted them to do. We realized that we needed longer springs, so that they would distribute the pressure, and have more springing power. We also realized that we needed to redesign the actual ratchet, so it would have space for the bicycle nark, which is the part that secures the end of the cables.</p>    <p>We made all these changes and it seems as if the right ratchet is set to go.</p>      <p>Force</p>    <p>Part of the reason we had such a hard time making the ratchets is because the angle that the ratchet locks into the gear has to be very precise. If the angle is wrong, the ratchet has rotational force, and doesn&#x2019;t actually lock into a stop. It is harder to place the ratchet that is in the upright position naturally, because we have to place the holes for the ratchet as if the ratchet is down. We are doing the guess and check method. </p>            <p>Back Tracking</p>    <p>We have been working on the placement of the ratchets and the springs and getting them just right. We went through and tried every single one of our prototypes again and really analyzed each one of them. It was good to see them all together. We decided that the sides should be as symmetrical as possible for the ratchets and it would be simplest to go back to the normal springs.</p>    <p>The steel springs are officially too unpredictable and hard to work with. We had the concept down and how the mechanism should work theoretically, but the steel springs were simply too unpredictable and were slowing us down, so we abandoned them.</p></div>

Although meeting the president was super-duper crazy cool, we are not done with this project yet. The Hand Drive broke when President Obama tried it at the White House.The reason it broke was because the brake was on when the president tried to use the hand drive, and this caused way too much force to be on just one ratchet piece, so it snapped off. Believe it or not, we were expecting this to happen, just not when the president tried it. This has been a problem that we have been struggling with in our design. As soon as we got back from the White House, we started a redesign.</p>      <p>When we sat down for our redesign, we came up with the idea of a planetary ratchet system, which means the force could be distributed throughout three ratchets as opposed to one. This works by having the ratchets on the inside of the gear rather than the reverse. When we figured out the mechanics of it, it worked out so that we could make both the top and bottom ratchet have the same rotation point. We thought about having them be on two different planes, but our epiphany came with the idea of combining the two ratchets into one. This way we still end up having the stacked gear as we did before so it can still go both forward and backward, but the entire unit is much more compact.</p>      <p>We had one main design change in figuring out how to make the ratchet mechanism. In our previous design, squeezing the bike handle would disengage one ratchet and engage the other. This was a little weird because instead of having a spring to push the ratchet down giving it resistance, the ratchet was relying on human error of the person squeezing the bike handle to have some give in their grip. Although this worked, it was not ideal. Nonetheless, we know more now and have come up with a better solution.</p>      <p>With the inner ratchets, we came up with a solution that involves a centerpiece in the center of the gear and the ratchets. It has three springs sticking out the sides that push outwards. The ratchets are designed with a curved back. When you twist the center piece, it pushes the springs to one side of the ratchets or the other, thus engaging either the top or bottom ratchets. It is a very elegant solution. We like elegant.<span></span></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-22803"><p>New Design</p>    <p>Once we had the center ratchet design almost working, it was time to face the facts. Although the planetary ratchets allowed for the Hand Drive to stay in one piece, it still didn&#x2019;t fix a big picture concept that we wanted to address. The Hand Drive is slow, and we feel we can make it more useful to the user if we address this. To make it faster we have to use planetary gears. In trying to learn about planetary gears and how they work, we met with a bike mechanic, Jason, from Broadway Bike. We realized that what we wanted to do was very similar to how a bike works. With Jason, we took apart a bike hub, and he showed us step by step what each part does. </p>    <p>We learned that with one set of planetary gears you can have three different speeds depending on what gear you&#x2019;re driving- &#x201C;driving&#x201D; meaning which gear is being spun. You can drive the planetary gears, which is high gear and the fastest gear. If you drive both the planetary gears and the annular gear (the ring gear) together that is considered neutral, meaning it&#x2019;s a 1 to 1 ratio between pedaling and the wheel. Driving just the annular gear is the slowest gear combination and is considered gearing down.</p>    <p>The bike hub works with a clutch that moves up and down pulled by a cable. The cable is under tension so that when you click to switch gears it pulls the clutch at just the right tension to engage either the planets, the planets and annular, or just the annular gear. </p>    <p>Knowing all this caused us to completely rethink our entire design, again. Learning about the concept of a clutch really changed our mindset, and we came up with two different variations of the Hand Drive involving the planetary gears.</p>    <p>The first was the same as our current planetary ratchet design but with a clutch instead of the detent, as well as planetary gears embedded into the base. The idea was that when the clutch is down, it engages the bottom ratchet and locks into the planetary gears, but when the clutch is up, it unlocks from the planetary gears and switches the ratchets into reverse. In this design the Hand Drive was only geared in the forward position.</p>    <p>The second design involved an extremely similar mechanism to the bike hub. It had a set of planetary gears in the middle and a ratchet mechanism on either side. One ratchet mechanism was always engaged with the planetary gears and the other would engage when the clutch was pulled. The ratchets would be in opposite directions. </p>    <p>In the end neither of these solutions worked. The first didn&#x2019;t work because the planetary gears weren&#x2019;t actually doing anything, because the gears were not connected right. The second solution didn&#x2019;t work because the ratchets ended up locking each other in place so the wheelchair wasn&apos;t able to move.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-22804"><p>Through long debate and lots of headaches we came up with a solution that would work. It is a combination of our two previous solutions. This solution involves a set of planetary ratchets with a ratchet on both the top and the bottom, with the ratchets facing opposite directions. The ratchets and planetary gears move as a unit either up or down when the clutch is pulled. The entire unit of ratchets and gears is inside an outer shell. The outer shell has the gear that the ratchets latch onto. When the clutch is pulled it pulls the entire set of gears and ratchets into the reverse direction, and when it is released it has a spring to pull it back into the forward position. </p><p>So far we have modeled the planetary gears, the gear cage and the ratchets. We are thinking that we are going to end up milling a lot of the parts out of aluminum, but reuse as many of the bike parts as we can. We are starting to feel the time pressure of the end of school and are working hard!</p></div>

It&apos;s been a long process but we finally feel like we are getting somewhere significant. We now have three final stages of the Hand Drive, one with a single double ratchet, one with three double sided ratchets, and one with planetary gears incorporated into it. Although we have gotten each design to a high level of functioning, we are still working and still trying to improve our designs.</p><p>In the big picture, one of our goals is to work towards a design where the planetary ratchets can be 3D printed instead of milled. We never want to lose sight of our goal to make the Hand Drive affordable and accessible for all. Wheelchair user statistics inform us that wheelchair users are very unlikely to have jobs and, partly as a 
consequence, are substantially more likely than the remainder of the 
population to live in poverty. At all ages, income levels for mobility 
device users tend to be low. If we can pull this Hand Drive off we can significantly improve the quality of life for many- at a price point they can handle, and with the personal satisfaction of building their Hand Drive  themselves with their own specifications.</p></div>
