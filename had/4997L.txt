                                <div id="post-body-16556"><p>Getting components for this project presents a really interesting challenge. I am sure a lot of Hackaday faithful are with me in enjoying the fruits of our interconnected globalized marketplace. Unfortunately the reach of globalization has its limits. South Sudan has no postal system, nor do any of the major shipping companies work here that I am aware of. Other East African countries have access to global shipping, but at quite a cost. Of course at the heart of any EV build is the electric motors. I have chosen to use four Chinese Unite MY1122ZXF 650W 24V DC brush geared motors for the simplicity of the built in planetary gear reduction. The motors are cheap and fairly light, but with four of them weight is still over 30kg which puts shipping cost over the cost of the motor. I sourced them on Aliexpress for just under $300 for the 4 motors and $350 for DHL shipping to Uganda. From Kampala, Uganda up to Yei, South Sudan where I am working one has to be a bit more creative. I lucked out and was able to get the motors brought up in a truck owned by one of the local churches. They owed me a favor because I have been fixing their bulldozer. The Bishop has a lot of pull around here, and so his truck clears customs fairly easily. If I couldn't use his truck I probably would have had to have the motors put on a passenger bus, and then have one of the local taxis carry it across the border with their passengers. This is the way I typically get replacement parts for machinery.</p><p>I was able to get most of the control circuitry shipped to someone who lives in the US who was coming out for a short-term visit. He then carried it out to me in his checked bag, and brought it in a small airplane.</p><p>Needless to say one needs to have some pre-planing out here, as getting things fast is next to impossible. The motors just arrived today with only a small dent in one of the fan casings. Unfortunately I won't get to play with the for a while as my wife and I are heading to Yida refugee camp for a week, but I am looking forward to some testing soon.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3916711429118621606.jpg" style="width: 492px; height: 276.75px;"></p></div>

I am long overdue for an update as things have progressed relatively well. I haven't done a great job of documenting each step, but I will be publishing plans once I work some of the kinks out. Here is a video of where things are now. I currently only have the front two motors hooked up, and I am controlling it from a normal 6 channel rc transmitter. I haven't made any adjustments yet to the stock settings yet, and the controls are very touchy. Steering is all done via differential motor control. The pivot point is just a pinned hinge connection. At the moment I am just using the skid steer setting on the sabertooth to control steering. </p><iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5r6EV0Xsa7I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I was really impressed with the amount of power, and the gearing ratios seems about right. I am not sure if I can get away with keeping things really simple and running the receiver directly into the sabertooth motor controller like I have now, or if I have problems running a potentiometer at the pivot point to give the angle and creating a pid program that keeps the vehicle tracking properly.  I will have to see what happens when I add the rear motors.</p><p>I am currently using two 230ah agm batteries that I pulled out a solar bank because they didn't match the other batteries. I think they have been pretty abused, so I don't hold high hopes that these will work well long-term. the only other electrical components at this point are a resettable fuse and a keyed battery disconnect. </p><p>I've skinned the frame with 1mm sheet metal and slapped some paint on it. The next major structure will be a dumping bed, and covers over the battery compartment. I am also in the process of sourcing solar panels, which I hope to use to make a solar canopy later on. This will be  both for shade/rain as well as charging. I am hoping to get at least 400 watts of panels preferably closer to 600 watts. I think this should be enough for a utility vehicle which spend most of it's time stationary. </p><p>I've taken very few photos, but here are a couple from my phone</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/153601431713405935.jpg"></p><p>The underside. The really nice thing about this configuration is that I don't need any axles, which means I get great ground clearance. I actually have better ground clearance than on our land cruiser. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4344611431713471480.jpg"></p><p>The body panels are just 1mm sheet metal I can buy locally and cheaply. I attached them to the 50x50mm angle with an arc welder. It is too thin to weld from the edge, so I weld a spot about 15mm from the edge. I let the rod burn through then form a puddle which acts like a rivet. It is amazingly strong and very quick. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2979281431713444922.jpg"></p><p>Poor quality photo, but this show how the two halves are connected. The back is pinned through the holes, which allows for movement in two directions.</p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-18380"><p>While I have generally been pretty happy with the vehicle so far, there are a number of areas I would like to improve on. In my mind the current vehicle is more of a test bed to see what will work and what won't for the next version. I already have a pretty significant redesign done on the computer, but I would like to keep testing the current version to find more weak points. One area I had to change was the motor mounts. While they fit nicely in the original frame, mounting them upside-down as I originally had them put too much flex in the drivetrain, and caused them to slip. Instead I have mounted them on top of the frame in a way that allows me to tension them by a bolt. See photos.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3373581432390479133.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3957621432390525402.jpg"></p><p>This view shows the connection to the wheel. Because of the built in planetary gearbox on the motor I can eliminate multi-stage gear reduction which greatly simplifies things.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9792511432390665322.jpg"></p>Amazing how well it works for the moment considering how few components there are.<p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/391311432390767557.jpg"></p>Put on a cover/place where the seats will mount. I am hoping that I can eventually put in a shelf so that this will also act as a locking toolbox.<p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6287391432390904516.jpg"></p>The lid flips up from two hinges on the back.<p>Another issue I am having is a bit more serious as I am hitting the current limit for the controller which is 60a per side continuous and 120a peak. Admittedly I am doing some torture testing as I am hitting this while trying to drive over big piles of loose sand, but it will continue to be an issue so I am looking at other options. The sabertooth 2x60 has built in over-current protection so I get a series of jolts when I am pulling between the 60a continuous and 120a 1 second peak. I think I need to find another controller. Which leads me to my question for everyone.</p><p>Does anyone have any experience with the OSMC open source motor controller? At 160a continuous and 300a peak it looks good on paper, but I feel like it is thermally questionable. Any newer designs out there with similar specs?</p></div>

I have been playing around with this thing, and it has been doing pretty well,
but it is definitely time to think about a permanent steering system. The
remote I have been using has been great for proof of concept, but if you have
ever tried to drive something with a remote while you were sitting on it you
know it is a good way to fall off. With the lack of engine, it is nice to be
able to get in from the front, but when you are driving you really need
something to hold on to. I’ve been thinking of a flip down bar that allows both
the passenger and driver to hold on, then flip up so that people can get out.
See photo.</p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1178431435513333151.jpg"><p>I
started thinking about what is the most intuitive way to drive a vehicle with differential
drive steering like this. A joystick makes sense, but doesn’t really allow one
to hold on well when you are going over rough terrain. I decided I wanted to
try out dual twist throttles. Like what you have as a motorcycle accelerator.
Unfortunately normal motorcycle parts wouldn’t work here because I want a
throttle that springs to the center position to allow for movement in both
forward and reverse. I decided to custom make a throttle set up that would be
in line with the grab bar in the front. I also decided to put an lcd in the
middle to give a live display of battery voltage, motor current, solar power
coming in and maybe a few other things.</p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1138401435513376581.jpg"><p>The
throttle assembly is all steel. The grips are a slightly larger diameter pipe
that slides nicely over the grab bar. The throttles turn a pair of 10k pots
which are then read by the atmega328p which will look at this plus the readings
from a pair of allegro ACS758 200a hall effect current sensors to determine the
pwm to the motor controller.</p><p>The display is just a simple 32 character LCD running with another Arduino pro mini. I will include several buttons to change some settings and also control horn and lights.<br></p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7519341435513396317.jpg"><p>Probably the hardest part was figuring out the spring return to center. At the moment I am using strips of rubber from an old truck inter-tube. It gives a nice strong feel. </p><p> </p><p>I
am looking forward to mounting this thing to try it out on the vehicle.</p></div>

called a hacker/maker space here in South Sudan, the idea of a
collaborative work space where people share tools and work on
different projects is nothing new. I have always loved working in
African workshops, and I think they really embody the ideas of the
hardware hackers. I have seen so many machines resurrected from the
dead, and hacked together out here. One of my best friends out here
runs a shop where they will work on everything from repairing engines
to building sawdust fueled bread ovens. The first time I met Anwar
who runs the shop I was looking for a pulley to  connect to the drive
shaft of a small tuk tuk like vehicle that I wanted to have power a
small table saw (this worked but it was ridiculously dangerous.) He
was busy trying to build a material elevator from a car axle for a
nearby construction site. We became fast friends. I often go to his
shop to have tea and discuss ides and work together. The shop itself
is open air, and could easily be confused for a junk yard, but the
things produced and fixed there are really impressive. Most of the
things they make are made from scrap metal they reclaim from
destroyed vehicles. This they weld with welders which they hand-wind
themselves. The only other tools in the shop are a 9&#x201D; angle
grinder, a few wrenches and hammers they have welded from various
drive shafts. 
</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6607271437906633030.jpg"></p><p><em>Working on the new frame</em></p><p>I have been talking
with these guys a lot about this project, and we have been sharing
ideas. I was excited for the second version of the utility vehicle to
build it with these guys. I have been redesigning the body of the
vehicle for quite a while so that it included such luxury items as
suspension, and a place for people to sit. I have been thinking a lot
about suspension, and how to source something locally which I can
also find on a continuous basis. I&apos;ve come back to the mass produced
motorcycles as a nice cheap source of coil over shock suspension. I
can get them for about $15 a pair. I am trying out a trailing arm
suspension system, that is really similar to the back end of a
motorcycle. I want to make sure nothing is too complicated to build, because I am hoping that welding shops like this one are the places where these vehicles could be produced.</p><p><br><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8993821437906683382.jpg"></p><p><em>The mascot of the welding shop</em></p><p>I used sketchup to
model the frame. While it is not a great tool some applications, I
find it great for modeling with standard steel sections. It let me
confirm clearances for motors and batteries. I cut all the frame
elements, and took them to Anwar&apos;s shop to assemble them. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/4863591437907170678.jpg"></p><p><em>Pieces for the front section ready for assembly</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p>Everything
was designed to be assembled easily. I assembled the frame over the
course of a few days, but I think I could do it in one day if I was
set up. I am really trying to not use anything specialized, and only
standard steel sections. Rolled sections have a welded seam which
makes them not really useful for bushings, however I&apos;ve found that
1/2&#x201D; water pipe with a slit cut in it slots inside the pipe I am
using and makes a great low friction bushing for the suspension.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8862721437893271314.jpg"></p><p><em>I will try to update with more detail, but you can get a general idea from the photo of how the suspension works. The motors have to be mounted on the arms so that chain tension remains constant. </em></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6910241437892834494.jpg"></p><p>We finished assembly of the frame, and took a quick test drive through town, which got a lot attention
in town.  </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5791391437892001321.jpg"></p></div>
