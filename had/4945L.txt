I have a pile of various heat sinks that I've scavenged over the years, but nothing was ideal for the chip and the box I put it in. I ended up combining two different heat sinks that fit together nicely, adding a fair smear of everyone's favorite silver-based thermal compound: Arctic Silver 5. </p><p>This seems to have worked well. While charging the new, improved heat sink gets very hot, but it's ability to dissipate much more heat allows the PB137 chip to maintain a bit more current, and then run at a lower temperature when it goes into float mode.</p><p>I also added a couple of filter capacitors per the recommendation of the manufacturer: a 1µF cap on the input side, and a 0.1µF cap on the output side. </p><p>While testing, I noticed that voltage changes on the input side were mirrored briefly on the output side of the chip. Therefor I decided to add a 2200µF cap on the input side to act as a voltage buffer of sorts.</p><p>Known Changes Needed: The indicator LED needs to be moved to the input side of the circuit, as it currently stays lit whenever the circuit is connected to the batteries. I've come up with a circuit to indicate battery voltage, which needs to be refined and integrated. The boost converters are currently inexpensive units sourced from Asia. It would be nice to come up with my own circuit, possibly based on a PWM signal from a µC.</p><p>Finally, those of you who look at the pictures will notice a rectifier bridge on the board. This is because I only have a single boost converter at the moment, so I am powering my prototype off of a 16.5VAC 40VA wall transformer so rectification and filtering (the 1000µF filter cap is under the board, so not visible in the photo) were needed temporarily. I also added a 100KΩ resistor to drain the caps when the charger is off.</p></ul></div>

                                <div id="post-body-16003"><p>I think I know why the PB137 I used needed such an immense heat sink and even then got very hot anyway: It was a bad chip. The other day it started blasting out even more heat, so I cut the power and started looking around for a reason. I found that the chip had developed an internal short from the input side to the output! Fortunately, the power supply I was using was a bit underpowered, so I didn't cook my battery bank. They never saw more than 13.8v, so they are just fine. If the short had been across all 3 leads or just to ground I would have known right away, as the fuse would have opened and killed the power, and I would have probed the thing right away instead of going through the trouble of testing the batteries and boost converter first.</p><p>I replaced the chip, and now the thing is sitting there maintaining my batteries and keeping quite cool. Very cool. So cool, in fact, that I think the original heat sink would have been more than adequate. It appears that the original PB137 chip was working well enough to pass factory testing, but once put into actual service it cooked itself to death. Its replacement is running so cool that I can barely discern any warmth coming from it, and the input current is rising and falling in such a way that I think I am seeing the chip working as it should have to begin with.</p><p>I have decided to put the boost converter back in place ahead of the PB137 board, and I will be purchasing another boost converter, probably a 600w version, for the output. These changes are taking place on my prototype, and may or may not appear in the final version of this project. This is still very much a work in progress.</p><p>Update: I blew another chip, but it was my own stupid fault. I was clumsy with the multimeter probes and ended up shorting across the chip... That was a very stupid thing to do. </p><p>The real reason for the update is that I think the reason the input current was fluctuating was that the boost converter was set too low. I set it to 16.0v unloaded, and under load it was dropping out to 15.5 or a little lower, causing the PB137 chip to shut down briefly. I have since turned it up to 17.0v, and I'm not going to try to set it under load again as I don't want to blow yet another chip. I only have 2 left! Currently it is running nice and cool and drawing a constant 320mA according to my power supply.<br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-16326"><p>As anyone who has been following knows, this has been an ongoing series of failures with an occasional project mixed in.</p><p> Yesterday and today are no different. Last night my local ham club held its weekly ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service) training net as usual. I had decided to join in (also as usual), but this week I wanted to do so on battery power. This  worked flawlessly, by the way, despite the fact that I blew yet another PB137 chip shortly before the net (that makes 3). Fortunately, the batteries were already very close to fully charged, and I was just attempting to top them off. Oh, well.</p><p>After spending some time on Amazon.com looking for a commercial solution to my problems, I started to think about what could be causing these problems. The things that come to mind immediately are a lack of current limiting and dirty power going to the PB137 chip.</p><p>Not knowing a heck of a lot about these things, as I have not had any formal education in electronics, I was operating under the assumption that what ST Microelectronics had written in the PB137's datasheet was actually correct. Apparently, this was a stupid thing to do. They claim that the chip had built-in current limiting, which it does not seem to have. In fact, they claim that their chip is indestructible! To quote them directly:</p><p>"It is available in TO-220 and it employs internal current limiting, thermal shut-down and safe area protection, making it essentially indestructible." -STMicroelectronics, PB137 Datasheet</p><p>Apparently this is marketing garbage, because I have managed to kill 3 of them in what I would consider to be normal use. This leads me to wonder about the 2.5A PTC "fuse" that I put ahead of the PB137 in the circuit, which didn't do a darn thing when the current draw went as high as 5A. So I shorted one across my variable power supply, and gradually increased the current. At 4.5A I ran up against the limits of my power supply, and the PTC was still sitting there quietly soaking up the current and laughing at me. Okay, I guess I'll switch over to AGC fuses instead of these stupid PTCs that don't do a darn thing. I'll probably also slap a resistor in-line with the chip, of such a value that it will prevent the chip from ever drawing more than 1A, an amount that I have scientifically determined to be just about right.</p><p>Okay, now what about dirty power? I know that my Astron power supply provides clean, low ripple DC. No worries there. However, the boost converter is a no-name generic cheapo straight off the boat from China. Sure enough, it had some nasty ripple. In fact, it had ripple at 200Hz or thereabouts, 30KHz or thereabouts, 14MHz or thereabouts, and pretty much everywhere in between. I spent an hour playing with various filtering schemes and capacitor values, and found that the low frequency ripple went away easily with a 1000µF capacitor, but nothing I threw at it would kill off the higher frequency stuff. For the time being I have given up in frustration, but I'm sure I will revisit this project in a few days.<br></p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-16420"><p>After spending the better part of today testing my brand new 600 Watt boost converter, I managed to tame its wild output down to a modest 30mV of ripple at 13.8V with a 30Ω resistive load (a 30Ω resistor, to be precise). I ended up designing and building a two-stage LCR filter (RLC? CRL? Who knows?) using a pair of 100mH chokes from Radio Shack, a pair of 2200µF axial capacitors, a pair of 1KΩ resistors, and a pair of 10nF ceramic caps just for the heck of it (and to clean up some of the 10MHz spikes). Here are the blurry results, taken with my crappy webcam because I was too lazy to get out my good camera:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6497291428804959973.jpg"></p><p>The yellow and blue traces are the filter input and output respectively. The top trace very clearly shows the pulses coming from the boost converter, which are what actually killed my third PB137 chip, though that was with my other boost converter. The scope is set to 1v/div, so those pulses are 1 - 2 volts at 1000 - 2000 Hz. Definitely not good for sensitive electronics. I approached the filter design process (remembering that I have an underdeveloped math gland) aiming to have the cutoff below 500 Hz. I lucked out, as the only chokes I have that I know the value of were the 100mH ones from Radio Shack. I was able to make a low-pass filter with a theoretical cutoff of 10 Hz. Since all I want to pass through the filter is plain old DC, anything above 0 Hz should work fine.  I still want to figure out how to squash those spikes, but clearly my filter has improved thing immensely. </p><p>The next part of this project will be to figure whether or not I need to completely start over from scratch or not. It occurred to me today that I'm going through an awful lot of effort to get 13.7 volts out of 13.8 volts. Yeah, the PB137 has a few other nice features, but why the heck can't I just charge the batteries using a Schottky diode and a 3Ω power resistor to limit current? The only reason I'm looking to use a boost converter now is to maintain 13.8V output at long as possible when the power's out, but if the thing is going to knock the crap out of my radios in the process, I may just skip that altogether and start working on a much simpler variant of this whole thing. I guess I need to do some more testing to find out if the boost converter adds useful battery time or not. I just need to figure out a load that will imitate a radio transmitting on low power (about 2.5A) without overheating like a radio stuck on transmit would. A power resistor of the correct value will probably work just fine for this. </p></div>

                                <div id="post-body-16722"><p>I wanted to title this log "Number 9, Number 9, Number 9...", but I'm not entirely sure how many iterations I've actually come up with for this project. Mind you, this project should be ridiculously simple, and might end up that way before I'm done. In fact, the only reason my entire circuit isn't a diode and a resistor is because of the diode's voltage drop. I need (or I think I do) to charge the batteries up to 13.7v, which won't happen when I'm dropping 0.9v across a Schottky diode. That small amount of voltage amounts to a fairly large amount of operating time once the crap hits the fan and the power goes out. It also means that the batteries won't be getting a full and proper charge, which could potentially impact their service life. Since they are not cheap, I'd like to avoid killing them off.</p><p>At this point, I have killed off any and all thoughts of using boost converters. Those stupid things are fine for driving LEDs, but terrible for driving anything else. You can't even use them as signal generators, as their horrifying output is all over the spectrum and ridiculously unstable. So much for that $35.</p><p>Back to what's happening now, the current version of my prototype circuit is just a charger being powered from an AC wall-wart. I've added a bridge rectifier, and re-purposed the filter circuit from last week to provide 22VDC for the PB137 chip. I added a 1Ω 10W resistor in series with the charger output, which is doing a fantastic job of limiting the current output to something that the poor PB137 can actually handle. The manufacturer claims short circuit and over-current protection, but I'm not buying it. I'm on my fourth PB137. They are not as indestructible as STM claims! Here's a blurry webcam photo (I'm still being lazy) of the current prototype:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5412471429477529972.JPG"></p><p>The white power resistor in the center is actually not in circuit. I originally tried using a 10Ω resistor, but it was too much and the batteries weren't charging at all, or at least not enough for my ammeter to notice. I took it out of circuit bud didn't bother removing it, and replaced it with the brass 1Ω resistor at the top of the image. Remember, this is a prototype, so failing to mount the thing properly isn't an issue. Besides, it barely gets warm. You can't tell from this crappy photo, but I got so sick of de-soldering and re-soldering the PB137 chips, that I cut down an 8 pin DIP socket and soldered that in instead. The regulator now just plugs in, and if this prototype survives testing (read: doesn't get chucked out the window with extreme prejudice because the PB137 chip blew again) I might just consider soldering the thing in to the final version of the charger. The sub-board on the left is the filter circuit I cooked up when testing the boost converters last week, which is severe overkill in this case as all it needs to do is smooth a bit of ripple coming out of the diode bridge.</p><p>I have been monitoring the performance of the circuit using an ammeter/voltmeter module between it and the batteries. The batteries were at 12.1V when I started charging them, and they initially drew 0.5A. The resistor was doing its job well at this point, as these batteries would normally try to pull 3A or more at that voltage, a current which experience has shown will kill a PB137 chip in a short amount of time. I monitored the temperature the PB137's heat sink and the limiting resistor with my ultra accurate digital thermometer, which is digital the same way a doctor's exam is digital. The regulator never got hot enough to cause discomfort, and the resistor barely got warm. As time went on, the voltage rose and the current dropped in a somewhat linear relationship. Currently, the batteries are sitting at 13.6V and the chip is assumed to be in float mode, because it is pulsing 0.1 - 0.2A several times a minute with short pauses of 0.0A in between. The ammeter I'm using only measures down to tenths of an Amp, so I can't report more accurate numbers than those. More accurate readings simply aren't needed in this case.</p><p>I find myself wondering about keeping this project in the Hackaday Prize competition, as that seems to be aimed at projects with a potential future as a retail product. While I could develop this for retail, it would be competing against other devices that are less expensive than this would be. I'll keep at it for now, but if anyone following this has any suggestions or ideas along those lines, now would be a good time to offer them up.</p><p>Thanks.<br></p></div>

I have discovered that "maintainer" is probably a better word than "charger" here. I ran my ham radio station for an entire week of normal use on battery power, and then started charging the batteries on day 8. After another week of charging for about 10 hours per day, they were back to full charge. </p><p>I did not run the charger 24 hours a day because it is still a prototype and I don't trust it not to have issues - yet. I suspect that the circuit is perfectly reliable, but why risk it?</p><p>Also, using this charger on a bank of 10 SLA batteries  is way beyond what one would normally run. I expect that this will normally be used to maintain 1 or 2 batteries, and maybe as many as 4. That it can competently handle 10 is a good thing to know.</p><p>More to come later.<br></p></div>

My original idea is long gone, my idea of using boost converters is junk, and the PB137 chip I was using as the star of the show just isn&apos;t good enough. Oh, it works, as long as you have a heat sink on it the size of a hub cap.</p><p>I have a new-ish idea of where to go with this, and if this doesn&apos;t work I&apos;m going to can the whole project and buy an off-the-shelf solution. Seriously, Astron makes a device that does exactly what I&apos;m hoping mine will, and it only costs $60 USD. Sheesh, why am I even bothering with all of this? Oh, right. It&apos;s because I don&apos;t have $60 to spend on a charger module.</p><p>More to come...<br></p></div>
